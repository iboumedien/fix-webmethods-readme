5.0 Fix Contents

WDY-5385

Deployer shows inconsistent dependencies while deploying to a
target group.

This issue is resolved. Now all dependencies are shown as
unresolved in the target group as Deployer gets the data from
the cache, and does not update the cache until the target group
or deployment map is deleted.

WDY-5448

Missing node.ndf in the selected Web Service Descriptor component 
causes a NullPointerException during Web Service Descriptor 
deployment. This issue occurs because Deployer does not select 
the .ndf file for the Web Service Descriptor when selecting the 
components in runtime based deployment, and when the Integration 
Server locale is set to a non-English language (for example, 
Japanese).

This issue is resolved. 

WDY-5455

When rolling back a BPM process during runtime based deployment, 
incorrect version information of the process is sent by Deployer 
to the target servers leading to a rollback failure.

This issue is now resolved.

WDY-5362

When a Deployer project that contains Java services is
created with Project Automator, the Java shared code is not
included in the build.

This issue is resolved. You can now include or exclude the Java
shared code for selected Java services. In the exported XML
file, add the new attribute "selectAllFiles" for the
"JavaService" element to include or exclude the Java
shared code as shown in following example:
<JavaService name="testDeployPkg.javaSvc:javaSvc" package=
"testDeployPkg" srcAlias="ISSource" selectAllFiles="true"/>
Set "selectAllFiles" to "true" to include the Java shared code.
The default value is "false". 

WDY-5204 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

Deployment fails after applying v9.12 Fix 1.

After applying Fix 1, variable substitution values could
not be imported and deployment fails. This is because the
XML tag "DeploementSet" in the varsub file was changed to
"DeploymentSet".

This issue is resolved. Now both "DeploementSet" and
"DeploymentSet" are supported in the varsub file. 

WDY-5301 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

Deployer displays the following error message for some assets
in a repository-based deployment scenario: "Comparison method
violates its general contract!".

While creating the Checkpoint for some assets in a
repository-based deployment scenario, or when transactional
deployment is enabled, Deployer displays the "Comparison
method violates its general contract!" error message.

This issue is resolved. 

WDY-5313 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

In a repository-based deployment scenario, Deployer fails to
enable Integration Server ports due to incorrect deployment
sequence of isconfiguration.
This issue is resolved. Deployer now deploys IS configuration
assets after packages are deployed. 

WDY-5342 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

Compilation fails if a package contains Java deprecated APIs.
Compilation fails if you select the "Compile Java Services"
option in the "Packages" area on the "Settings" page, and
the services contain deprecated APIs.
This issue is resolved. Deployment is now successful
without any errors. 

WDY-5391 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

When using webMethods Deployer, deployment of adapter connection 
to a target Integration Server fails and the Deployer displays 
the following error: "The target server is Integration Server, 
which does not support this feature.” This issue occurs only when 
variable substitution is performed on adapter connection.

This issue is now resolved. 

WDY-5392 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

webMethods Deployer does not list the available ACLs and the 
options available for "Select Authorization" when authorizing a 
project.

This issue is now resolved. 

WDY-5200 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

Variable substitutions cannot be performed with empty values.
 
While importing variable substitutions with properties that
have empty values, Deployer ignores the empty values and
takes the original or default values.

This issue is resolved. A new property "allowEmptyValues" has
been added as a part of the variable substitution schema.
The default value is "false". If you set "allowEmptyValues"
to "true" in the variable substitution file (.vs), and if an
empty value is present for any property, then Deployer
maintains the empty value for that property. You can also
achieve this from the user interface by enabling the
"Allow Empty Values" option in the "Target Substitutions
and Source Values" pane. 

WDY-5058 (DEP_10.1_Fix1)

Dependency resolution is not working properly in runtime-based
deletion sets.

When entire Integration Server packages are selected for
deletion in runtime-based projects and if there are
referenced assets in the packages, the "Remove" option does
not remove the selected assets from the packages.

This issue is resolved. 

6.0 Platform Support

the same platforms and operating systems and with the same JREs
