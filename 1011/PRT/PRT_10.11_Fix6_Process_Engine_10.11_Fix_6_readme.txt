In webMethods Process Engine, support for callback services is now added.

You can create and configure a custom callback service using the pub.prt.callback folder, which contains the specification of the callback service and the structure of the callback events.

pub.prt.callback:CallbackService - The specification of the callback service. It has the following input parameters:
EventType - One of the following types ProcessInstanceChange, ProcessInstanceError, ProcessInstanceLogMessage, ProcessInstanceLogCustomId, ProcessStepInstanceChange, ProcessStepInstanceError, ProcessStepLoopInstanceChange, and ProcessStepInstanceTransition.

AuditTimestamp - Timestamp when the audit was generated.

EventData - Corresponds to the EventType structure.

Process Engine will invoke your custom callback service during the execution of process instances.

With webMethods Process engine, logged field is incorrectly truncated.

Logged field values of type String were truncated to 512 bytes instead of 1024 bytes which the database allowed.

Note: ProcessAudit database component should be migrated to version 81.2
