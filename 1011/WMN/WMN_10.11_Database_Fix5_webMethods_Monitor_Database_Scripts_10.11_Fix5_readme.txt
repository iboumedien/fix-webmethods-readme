The issue is resolved.

WMN-8167(MON_10.11_Database_Fix4)
In webMethods Monitor, when Integration Server uses an Oracle Server database and OPERATION_PARAMETER.USE_BATCH_ARCHIVE is

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7958(MON_10.11_Database_Fix3)
In webMethods Monitor, when you terminate an Oracle Database archive service and start a new service, a message for a 
successful operation appears, but no data is archived.

The issue is resolved. To archive data, grant SELECT privilege to the Archive User:
1. Install the MON_10.11_Database_Fix3 fix.
2. Open Oracle Database and log in as a SYS user.
3. Execute the "GRANT SELECT ON V_$SESSION TO <archive_user>;" SQL procedure, where <archive_user> is the user used to 
log in to the Archive database.

With webMethods Monitor, executing the PROCESS_ARCHIVE.START_PROCESSARCHIVE stored procedure results in a 
"(full) year must be between -4713 and +9999, and not be 0" error message. The issue occurs because a newly 
created PRA_PROCESS_CUSTOM Oracle database table has a different column order than a migrated PRA_PROCESS_CUSTOM 
Oracle database table.

database runs indefinitely.

In webMethods Monitor, when Integration Server uses a Microsoft SQL
Server database, the serviceArchive services fail to pass the batchSize
parameter to the SERVICE_ARCHIVE_START_SERVICEARCHIVE stored procedure.
Hence, the SERVICE_ARCHIVE stored procedure runs indefinitely.
