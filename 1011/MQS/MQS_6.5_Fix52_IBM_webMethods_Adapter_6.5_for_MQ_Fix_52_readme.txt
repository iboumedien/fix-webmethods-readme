This issue is resolved. Now, execute the service if you want to update the 
listener.

IMQ-1304(MQS_6.5_Fix40)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter,the following new watt property is added which supports 
both TLS and SSL connection on a single Integration Server,
watt.WmMQAdapter.ShowCipherSuit=true

When you set the value of the property as true, then the Connection page shows 
the cipher suits for both SSL and TLS connections, so that you can create both 
the connections and when you set the value as false, then the cipher spec for 
either SSL or TLS connection appears based on the IBM property.

IMQ-1292(MQS_6.5_Fix39)

API.
 
IMQ1251(MQS_6.5_Fix38)
In Websphere MQ Adapter, unable to overide the connection parmeters of SSL 
Connection.

This issue is resolved. Now, connection parameters of SSL Connection can be 
overidden in all the services.

IMQ-1257(MQS_6.5_Fix38)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, unable to update the listener parameters Listener 
Properties section.

When you enter the new values of listener parameters and save the changes in 
Listener Properties section, then these values are not replaced by the old 
values in Listener screen.

This issue is now resolved.

IMQ-1214(MQS_6.5_Fix38)
In webMethods MQ Adapter, the migration service for a Multi_Queue Listener is 
missing.

This issue occurs when you migrate the assets from a Multi_Queue Listener. 
During migration, if there is a change in the Queue Name, then you manually 
delete and recreate the Multi_Queue Listener.

This issue is resolved. Now, wm.mqseries.admin:updateMultiQueueListener service 
is introduced, which deletes and recreates the listener assets.

IMQ-1233(MQS_6.5_Fix37)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, authentication error occurs while creating a
SSL connection.

This issue occurs while creating a SSL connection, which consist of the UserID 
authentication in the backend.

This issue is now resolved. 

IMQ-1240(MQS_6.5_Fix37)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, editing the exsiting connection results in 
the creation of new connections in the backend. However, these newly created 
conections are not closed, unless you restart the Integeration Server.

This issue is now resolved. 

IMQ-1235(MQS_6.5_Fix37)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the extra logging related to Queue Name are 
printed as part of info level.

This issue is resolved. Now, the logs are moved to trace level.

IMQ-1229(MQS_6.5_Fix36)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, While creating the connections, if any 
thread gets into a hung state, the  connection factory is locked. The remaining 
threads cannot create connections in other connection pools. 

This issue is resolved. 

IMQ-1219(MQS_6.5_Fix36)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the MQ messages are lost when the listener 
fails to put the undeliverable messages to system dead letter 
queue(SYSTEM.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE).

This issue is resolved. Now, if the listener fails to put the undeliverable 
messages to system dead letter queue, then it moves back the messages onto the 
original queue.

IMQ-1223(MQS_6.5_Fix36)
In webMethods MQ Adapter,the msgHeader property PutApplType populates 
incorrectly for the Get and Put service.

This issue occurs because the adapter does not support all the values of 
PutApplType msgHeader property. Therefore, the mapping of MQAT_QMGR_PUBLISH 
value to PutApplType msgHeader fails.

This issue is resolved. The adapter now allows all the values which are 
supported by the backend. 

IMQ-1225(MQS_6.5_Fix36)
webMethods MQ Adapter, the adapter supports MQ CCDT feature. This issue is 
resolved. This fix supports the new feature for CCDT.

IMQ-1198(MQS_6.5_Fix35)
The open input count increases on MQ server, as a result the "MQ reason code 
2017" is displayed.

If the MQ get or put services are executed multiple times, then the open input 
count on the MQ server increases.

This issue is now resolved.

IMQ-1197(MQS_6.5_Fix35)
In webMethods MQ Adapter 6.5 Fix 33, the open input count property of the queue 
increases on the MQ server.

This issue occurs if the listner is enabled and it gets the MQ message multiple 
times, then the open input count property on the MQ server increases.
 
This issue is now resolved.

IMQ-1196(MQS_6.5_Fix35)
In webMethods MQ Adapter 6.5, the Inquire Queue Manager/Queue services fails to 
inquire the Queue which is of type remoteQueue.
 
When the service tries to inquire a Queue, where the input is a remoteQueue, the
following error meassage is displayed in the error logs: "MQJE001: Completion 
Code 2, Reason 2045"
 
This issue is resolved. For the new input parameter, if the queue name is a 
remoteQueue, then you need to set the value to true.

IMQ-1212(MQS_6.5_Fix35)
In webMethods MQ Adapter 6.5, performance impact after changing the 
implementation of the queue name parameter for OverrideConnection.

When executing a Get service or Put service each time, an extra call was created
to open the respective queue, to put or get the message, and then close the 
queue.
Due to which the performance level was dropped.

This issue is now resolved. The changes are reverted.

IMQ-1201(MQS_6.5_Fix34)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 support for new Admin screens IS 9.10 
onwards. 

webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 Admin UI pages did not support new format of
screens developed for IS 9.10. 

This issue is resolved now by modifying the webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 
pages.

IMQ-1176(MQS_6.5_Fix33)
In webMethods webSphere MQ Adapter, the adapter creates a new connection when 
queueName is passed in the overrideConnection parameter.
 
When the queueName is passed in the overrideConnection parameter, the adapter 
creates a new connection during the execution of the adapter services.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter uses only the existing connection which
is referring to the new queueName for the execution of specific adapter services.

IMQ-1172(MQS_6.5_Fix32)
In webMethods webSphere MQ Adapter, MQ listener should not listen to the remote 
queue.

If MQ listener is connected to the remote queue, the listener notification 
should not be executed.

This issue is now resolved. 

IMQ-1173(MQS_6.5_Fix32)
In webMethods webSphere MQ Adapter, an exception occurs while creating a service
using MQ transactional connection.

When creating any service using MQ transactional connection, if the connection 
parameter values are overridden by Override connection parameters in the service,
then the service fails with an exception.

This issue is now resolved.

IMQ-1136(MQS_6.5_Fix31)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, message flows to an incorrect queue when 
there are multiple Put services which are running simultaneously.

This issue occurs when there are multiple Put services, where one of the service
consist of input specified in overrideConnection property. The Put services runs
simultaneously with the common MQ connection. The message flows to the incorrect
queue instead of the queue configured as part of MQ connection.

This issue is resolved. 

IMQ-1155(MQS_6.5_Fix31)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, an error occurs while creating the 
Notification document.

This issue occurs while processing the MQ message for creating a notification, 
so that the document for JMS headers can be created. Therefore, creation of 
document for JMS headers requires Integration Server public services which are
pub.xml:xmlStringToXMLNode, pub.xml:xmlNodeToDocument for converting xml file to
IData. The following error message is displayed during the creation of the 
document:

Active transaction detected while completing service pub.xml:xmlStringToXMLNode.
Rolling back pending operations.

This issue is resolved.

IMQ-1156 (MQS_6.5_Fix31)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the Get service and the Listener displays an
incorrect pipeline structure after installing the MQ Adapter Fix 30.

This issue occurs because pipeline structure for Get service and Listener 
Notification consist of an extra <usr> document, if the incoming message has an 
JMS and User-Defined properties.

This issue is now resolved. 

IMQ-1153 (MQS_6.5_Fix30)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter could not retrieve the list of available queue 
names from the MQ backend.

This issue occurs when editing an existing connection which includes a list of 
connection parameters such as Host Name, Queue Manager Name and Port Number. 
The Queue Name(s) field displays the following error message: "The list of 
Available queues could not be retrieved from the Queue Manager".

This issue is now resolved.

IMQ-1137 (MQS_6.5_Fix30)
In webMethods webSphere MQ Adapter, MQ listener is unable to retrieve the MQ 
backout queue name.

This issue occurs when the Queue Manager consist of different character encoding
which is, EBCDIC with Euro character. Therefore, the queue name has to be 
decoded with the queue managers encoding to obtain a valid backout queue name.

This issue is resolved. Now, for MQ backend version 7.5 and above, the customer 
is required to add the watt property watt.WmMQAdapter.MQServer75AndAbove=true, 
so that the queue name is retrieved as a string value. If the value is set to 
false, then the queue name cannot be retrieved because the facility is not 
available in the lower version of MQ jars.

IMQ-1096 (MQS_6.5_Fix29)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter should support IBM certified TLS Cipher Specs 
for JAVA clients running on a non-IBM JDK. 

This issue is resolved. The adapter now supports IBM certified TLS Cipher Specs 
for JAVA clients running on a non-IBM JDK.

IMQ-1138 (MQS_6.5_Fix29)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter does not consider JMS User-Defined properties 
that are defined multiple times in an MQ message.

When an MQ message contains multiple occurrences of a JMS User-Defined property 
where the property is defined as an attribute and a value, the adapter does not 
consider all the occurrences of the property. The Get adapter service ignores 
the second occurrence of the property when the MQ message is added to IData.

This issue is resolved. The adapter now considers all occurrences of JMS 
User-Defined properties in an MQ message. 

IMQ-1125 (MQS_6.5_Fix29)
In webmethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the MQ message created from running a Get or
Put service contains empty tags in the message header.

The message header of the MQ message created from running a Get or Put service 
contains empty tags for JMS Properties and User-Defined Properties which are not
required.

This issue is resolved. Now, the MQ message does not contain tags for properties
that are not defined in the service. 

IMQ-1131 (MQS_6.5_Fix29)
In webmethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the text boxes of the Dead Letter Queue 
properties are enabled even though the value of the Handle Backout ReQueue 
property is set to "true".

In the Configure Listener Type screen, when the value of the Handle Backout 
ReQueue property is set to "true" the text boxes of the Dead Letter Queue 
properties, Dead Letter Queue Name, Dead Letter Queue Manager Name, and 
Deadletter Backout Threshold are still enabled.

This issue is resolved. Now, when the value of the Handle Backout ReQueue 
property is set to "true", the text boxes of the Dead Letter Queue properties 
are disabled. 

IMQ-1123 (MQS_6.5_Fix29)
In webmethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, when an SSL connection is enabled, 
restarting the Integration Server causes a connection failure between the 
adapter and the queue manager.

When Integration Server is restarted while an SSL connection between the adapter
and the MQ Server is still enabled, the adapter disables the SSL connection. 
This causes a connection failure between the adapter and the queue manager. The 
error logs contain the error code 2397.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter does not disable an enabled SSL 
connection after restarting the Integration Server. 

IMQ-1116 (MQS_6.5_Fix29)
In webmethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, when you click the 'Find Queues' button 
secure information related to the connection is displayed in the address bar.

When you click the 'Find Queues' button in the Configure Connection Type screen,
the adapter uses the HTTP GET method to refresh the Connections screen. The HTTP
GET call appends all the information related to the connection in the address 
bar of the browser. This information also includes the password of the 
connection.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter uses the HTTP POST method to refresh 
the Connections screen. 

IMQ-1120 (MQS_6.5_Fix28)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, undeliverable messages for a listener can now be moved
to the Backout ReQueue queue.

The property, 'Handle Backout ReQueue' in the listener configuration page of 
WebSphere MQ Adapter allows you to move undeliverable messages for a listener to
either the Backout ReQueue queue, or the Dead Letter Queue. The Backout ReQueue 
queue is specified in the queue properties of 
WebSphere MQ server. 

When the property is set to true, the undeliverable messages are moved to the 
Backout ReQueue queue. When the property is set to false, the undeliverable 
messages are moved to the Dead Letter Queue. The default is false.

IMQ-1067 (MQS_6.5_Fix27)
In Websphere MQ Adapter, the Find Queues function does not display the list of 
queues for SSL connections.

By default, the adapter uses the watt property watt.adapter.MQ.UsePCFAgentToFindQ
to get the list of queues for all types of connections.
 
This issue is resolved. The watt property watt.adapter.MQ.UsePCFAgentToFindQ is 
removed and the adapter now uses IBM's PCFMessageAgent API class to get the list
of queues for all types of connections. 

IMQ-1106 (MQS_6.5_Fix27)
In Websphere MQ Adapter, the filter is reset when the state of a listener from a
filtered list is changed.

When filters are applied to a list of listeners in Adapters > Websphere MQ 
Adapter > Listeners page of Integration Server Administrator, changing the state 
of a listener from the filtered list causes the filter to be reset. Consequently, 
the adapter displays all the listeners on the page.
 
This issue is now resolved. Only the filtered list of listeners is displayed 
after changing the state of a listener to which a filter is applied. 

IMQ-1108 (MQS_6.5_Fix27)
In Websphere MQ Adapter, running the Inquire Queue Manager/Queue service on a 
clustered queue fails.

In Developer or Designer, when you run the Inquire Queue Manager/Queue service 
on a clustered queue to query "QueueProperties.BackoutRequeueQName", the adapter
returns an error code 2068.

This issue is resolved. 

IMQ-1087 (MQS_6.5_Fix26)
In webMethods MQ Adapter, audit logging is enabled for internal services. 

Log entries are created in the audit log for internal services of MQ Adapter 
because the "Enable Auditing" and "Log on" properties are enabled. 

This issue is resolved. "Enable Auditing" property is disabled and the "Log on" 
property is set to create a log entry in the audit log only if an internal 
service throws errors.

IMQ-1070 (MQS_6.5_Fix26)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, the listener automatically selects the first connection
from the "Connection Name" drop-down list if the original connection does not 
exist. 

When editing a listener, if the "Connection Name" associated with the listener 
does not exist, the listener selects the first available connection from the 
drop-down list. WebSphere MQ Adapter does not display any warning message 
stating that the "Connection Name" has changed. 

This issue is resolved. MQ Adapter displays the following message on the edit 
page of the listener if the listener selects a different connection: 

"Connection previously associated with this listener is not found."

IMQ-1079 (MQS_6.5_Fix26)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, services and listener notifications are failing with an
error message. 

This issue occurs because of a mismatch between the data input to the msgHeader 
properties MsgId and CorrelId, and their data type. The data type of MsgId and 
CorrelID were previously configured as String. As part of MQS_6.5_Fix21, MsgId 
and CorrelId are configured as Object. 

This issue is resolved. The new watt properties enable you to set the data type 
of MsgId and CorrelID in existing services and listener notifications. 

To set the MsgId and CorrelID as String, add the two watt properties - 
watt.WmMQAdapter.MQMD.CorrelID.DataType.String, and  
watt.WmMQAdapter.MQMD.MessageID.DataType.String. Set them to true. With this 
watt property, you can avoid re-creating the services and listener notifications 
for which the MsgId and CorrelId properties are configured as String. 
   
To let the adapter identify the data type set for the MsgId and CorrelId 
properties, add the watt property - watt.WmMQAdapter.instrospectHeaderDataTypes.
Set it to true. The data is passed as String or Object to the properties as 
configured.

IMQ-1066 (MQS_6.5_Fix26)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, the MsgId and CorrelId properties are set to Object 
data type when a new service or listener notification is created. 

When a new service or listener notification is created, the msgHeader properties
MsgId and CorrelId are set to Object data type instead of String. However, the 
MsgId and CorrelId properties in existing services and listener notifications 
are set to String data type. 

You must re-create the services and listener notifications to set the data type 
of the MsgId and CorrelId properties to Object

IMQ-1049 (MQS_6.5_Fix26)
Changes to address security vulnerabilities found in Integration Server 
Administrator. This fix resolves several cross-site scripting (XSS) issues found
during internal security testing

IMQ-1057 (MQS_6.5_Fix25)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, Adapter Notification service generates duplicate 
information in both, msgBody and msgBodyByteArray fields.

The same notification information is generated in msgBody as well as 
msgBodyByteArray as two different data types. This may cause an increase in 
memory consumption and network traffic especially in the case of large files.

This issue is resolved. The Adapter Notification wizard of the WebSphere MQ 
Adapter now includes a new tab, Msg properties where you can choose the field to
generate notification information. 

IMQ-1039 (MQS_6.5_Fix25)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, after setting the SSL Option, Internet Explorer takes a
long time to respond.

When using Internet Explorer to set the SSL Option in the Connections page of MQ
Adapter, there is a delay in the response time of the browser.
  
This issue is now resolved. 

IMQ-1048 (MQS_6.5_Fix25)
In WebSphere MQ Adapter, Find Queues service fails during the configuration of a
new connection on the IBM z/OS platform.

When you click the Find Queues button on the Connections page of MQ Adapter, the
adapter displays an MQ 3003 error. This issue occurs because the MQ message that
the adapter constructs to retrieve the list of queue names is invalid.

This issue is resolved. The watt property,
watt.adapter.MQ.UsePCFAgentToFindQ, is now set to True and the MQ message is 
constructed using IBM's PCFMessageAgent API class.

IMQ-1013 (MQS_6.5_Fix25)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the output value for the correID in the 
message header of a WebSphere MQ message is inconsistent. 

In WebSphere MQ Adapter, the CorreId field of the Put service msgHeader property
gets processed as String, which results in inconsistent output. The issue occurs
because the CorreId field is binary and when it is converted to bytes, the 
adapter uses the default encoding of the OS platform on which
Integration Server is running. 

This issues is resolved. Now the CorreId field of the msgHeader property takes 
an Object as input and the Put service maps the Object to a byte[] in the output.

IMQ-1035 (MQS_6.5_Fix24)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, configuring an SSL connection using keystore
and truststore aliases is not possible on Integration Server 8.0. 
  
Now WebSphere MQ Adapter provides support for SSL connections using keystore and
truststore aliases with Integration Server 8.0. 
  
Before you configure an SSL connection in the adapter, you must create a 
keystore alias and truststore alias in Integration Server Administrator. For 
information about creating keystore and truststore aliases, see "webMethods 
Integration Server Administrator's Guide". 
  
To configure an SSL connection, when configuring a WebSphere MQ Adapter 
connection in Integration Server Administrator, specify values for the following
fields on the Connections screen: - SSL Option, where the SSL Option is 
"keystore alias". 
- SSL Keystore Alias. The alias for the keystore file. 
- SSL Truststore Alias. The alias for the truststore file.

IMQ-1031 (MQS_6.5_Fix24)
Trying to disable a webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter connection results in a 
JavaScript error. 

When you attempt to disable a WebSphere MQ Adapter connection, a JavaScript 
error is displayed and the connection remains enabled. 

This issue is resolved. 

IMQ-1030 (MQS_6.5_Fix24)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, configuring and managing SSL connections 
results in the following issues: 

- After applying MQS_6.5_Fix23, when you attempt to create a WebSphere MQ 
Adapter SSL connection using keystore and truststore aliases in Integration 
Server Administrator, the fields to create this type of SSL connection - SSL 
Option, SSL Keystore Alias, and SSL Truststore Alias - are missing. 

- After applying MQS_6.5_Fix22, the Edit Connection, Copy Connection, and View 
Connection screens do not properly display some of the fields for SSL 
connections. On the Edit Connection and Copy Connection screens, this issue 
affects both connections using a keystore alias and connections using a keystore 
file. The View Connections screen does not display the fields for connections 
using a keystore alias. 

The issues are resolved.

IMQ-1020 (MQS_6.5_Fix23)
Executing the webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter Request/Reply adapter service 
takes time when an invalid CCSID is specified. 

The performance of the WebSphere MQ Adapter Request/Reply service is slow when 
using an invalid or unsupported Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) in the 
adapter connection. The issue occurs because converting the JMS Headers and 
Message Body to String takes too much time when using an invalid character set. 

This issue is resolved. Two new watt properties, 
"watt.WmMQAdapter.RequestReplyService.ignoreReplyJMSHeader" and 
"watt.MQAdapter.RequestReplyService.skipReplyMsgBodyToStringConversion", 
are introduced to skip the JMS header and message body processing in the Reply 
message when the adapter service executes. 

Adapter Configuration Parameter Reference: 
watt.WmMQAdapter.RequestReplyService.ignoreReplyJMSHeader 
Ignores the JMS Headers in the Reply message.
Values are: 
-true. The services ignores the JMS Header in the Reply 
 message. 
- false (default). The service processes the JMS Header in the 
  Reply message. 

watt.MQAdapter.RequestReplyService.skipReplyMsgBodyToStringConversion Does not 
convert the Message Body content of the Reply message to String. 
Values are: 
- true. The services does not convert the Message Body in the 
Reply message to String. 
- false (default). The service converts the Message Body in the 
Reply message to String. 

For more information about setting the watt properties and working with extended
configuration settings, see "webMethods Integration Server Administrator's 
Guide". 

IMQ-1012 (MQS_6.5_Fix22)
With Integration Server 8.2 and higher, when configuring Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL) connections in WebSphere MQ Adapter, you can use keystore and truststore 
aliases.

Before you configure an SSL connection in WebSphere MQ Adapter, you must create 
a keystore alias and truststore alias in Integration Server Administrator. For 
information about creating keystore and truststore aliases, see "webMethods 
Integration Server Administrator's Guide". 
 
To configure an SSL connection, when configuring a WebSphere MQ Adapter 
connection in Integration Server Administrator, specify values for the following
fields on the Connections screen: 
- SSL Option, where the SSL Option is "keystore alias".
- SSL Keystore Alias. The alias for the keystore file.
- SSL Truststore Alias. The alias for the truststore file.
 
For more information about configuring WebSphere MQ Adapter connections, see 
"webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter Installation and User's Guide".

IMQ-1021 (MQS_6.5_Fix22)
Accessing the DSP pages of the WmMQAdapter package fails when webMethods 
Integration Server is using the CSRF guard feature. 

When you enable the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) guard in Integration 
Server, access to the dynamic server pages (DSP) of the WmMQAdapter package is 
denied. 

This issue is now resolved. 

Note: 
Integration Server 8.2 SP2 now provides the CSRF guard feature to prevent 
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. For more information about securing 
Integration Server with CSRF guard, see CSRF Guard Enhancement for Integration 
Server Documentation Supplement Version 8.2 SP2 at 
http://documentation.softwareag.com.

IMQ-1011 (MQS_6.5_Fix22)
Using webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter to override an adapter connection that 
contains a Security Exit parameter fails with an error. 

In WebSphere MQ Adapter, when a cache thread creates an adapter connection with 
a Security Exit parameter, while another cache thread attempts to create an 
adapter connection with the values, specified in the overrideConnection property
of an adapter service, the adapter returns the following error: "Queue manager
cannot be initialized." The issue occurs because under high message load the 
second thread sets the value of the Security Exit parameter of the first thread 
to null. 

The issue is resolved.

IMQ-981 (MQS_6.5_Fix21)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter does not process correctly MQ messages that have
JMS headers with complex XML format (such as the messages in IMQ-974). 

When WebSphere MQ Adapter receives a message that has JMS headers with complex 
XML format, the adapter does not convert the JMS headers to IData correctly. 

The issue is resolved. A new watt property, 
"watt.WmMQAdapter.useInternalDecodeXML", ensures that JMS headers in complex XML
format are properly converted to IData. 

Adapter Configuration Parameter Reference: 
watt.WmMQAdapter.useInternalDecodeXML 
Converts MQ messages with complex XML format in the JMS headers. Values are: 
- true (default). WebSphere MQ Adapter uses its internal logic to 
  handle JMS message headers. 
- false. WebSphere MQ Adapter uses Integration Server public 
  services to convert JMS header XML to IData. 

For more information about setting the watt.WmMQAdapter.useInternalDecodeXML 
property and working with extended configuration settings, see "Administering 
webMethods Integration Server".  

IMQ-974 (MQS_6.5_Fix20)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter fails to send a JMS message over WebSphere MQ, 
with a VV-005 error. 

When using WebSphere MQ Adapter to send a JMS message over WebSphere MQ, the 
adapter returns the following error: "/JMSProperties errorCode=VV-005 Error". 
The error occurs when: 
- The custom header parameter for the JMS Properties is defined
  with an integer value. 
- The "Validate when published" option for the publish document
  is set to true.
 
This issue is resolved. The custom header parameter for the JMS Properties 
accepts data types other than String. 

IMQ-968 (MQS_6.5_Fix20)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the output value for the message ID in the 
message header of a WebSphere MQ message is inconsistent. 

In WebSphere MQ Adapter, the MsgId field of the Put service msgHeader property 
gets processed as String, which results in inconsistent output. The issue occurs
because the MsgId field is binary and when it is converted to bytes, the adapter 
uses the default encoding of the OS platform on which Integration Server is 
running. 

This issues is resolved. Now the MsgId field of the msgHeader property takes an 
Object as input and the Put service maps the Object to a byte[] in the output.

IMQ-964 (MQS_6.5_Fix19)
When webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter passes a message, getting the correct 
message type from the message MQ header fails. 

In WebSphere MQ Adapter, getting the correct message type from the MQ header of 
a message fails because the adapter supports only the following message types: 
MQMT_REQUEST, MQMT_REPLY, and MQMT_REPORT. If the message contains another 
message type, by default the adapter selects the MQMT_DATAGRAM message type. 

This issue is resolved. WebSphere MQ Adapter uses the correct message type in 
the message MQ header. Along with the four supported message types, WebSphere MQ
Adapter now supports all message types supported by the WebSphere MQ server 
version 6, as follows: MQMT_APPL_FIRST, MQMT_APPL_LAST, and MQMT_SYSTEM_LAST.

IMQ-946 (MQS_6.5_Fix18)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter's asynchronous listener notification throws a 
NullPointerException if the JMSValues object is null. 

When processing an MQRFH2 header, the adapter's asynchronous listener 
notification throws a NullPointerException in getJMSHeader(), if the JMSValues 
object is not available. 

This issue is resolved. A null check has been added for the JMSValues object, 
which solves the problem. 

IMQ-942 (MQS_6.5_Fix17)
When you execute a webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter service, using an adapter 
connection without a security exit property after using a connection with a 
security exit property, the service fails. 

The execution of a WebSphere MQ Adapter service fails with connections that use 
the overrideConnection property when you use the connections in the following
sequence: first a connection without a security exit property, then a connection
with security exit, and again the connection without security exit. 

This issue is now resolved. Each time you create or override the connection, the
values in the WebSphere MQ Adapter environment are set to null and the adapter
service executes successfully.

IMQ-939 (MQS_6.5_Fix17)
The webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter PCF Command service throws an exception when
configured to use the Set Authority Record PCF command. 

When you configure the PCF Command service to use the SET_AUTH_REC PCF command, 
the service throws the following exception: "The value expected on the ObjectType
is integer." The issue occurs because the order of the mandatory parameters in 
the SET_AUTH_REC command is reversed (the ObjectType parameter comes before the 
ProfileName parameter). 

This issue is resolved. The order of the mandatory parameters in the SET_AUTH_REC
command has been corrected: the ProfileName parameter is followed by the 
ObjectType parameter. Now the PCF Command service executes successfully.

IMQ-923 (MQS_6.5_Fix16)
The UUID attribute in the envelope of a published notification, generated by 
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, has a length of 80 bytes that exceeds the
length limit of the database column for PRTUUIDXREF.UUID.

webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter generates the UUID attribute based on the MsgId 
of the message. When the MsgId is long, this results in a UUID attribute that is
longer than the length limit of the database column.

The issue is now resolved. With the new Integration Server
watt property "watt.WmMQAdapter.UUID.msgIdBasedUUID", you
can choose whether to generate the UUID attribute based on
the MsgId, or use the new approach that limits the maximum
length up to 30 bytes.

To configure the "watt.WmMQAdapter.UUID.msgIdBasedUUID" property:

1. From the Integration Server Administrator, go to Settings > Extended.

2. Click "Edit Extended Settings". In the Extended Settings editor, type the 
   following:

   watt.WmMQAdapter.UUID.msgIdBasedUUID=<value>

   where <value> is true or false.
   When you set the parameter to:
   - false, WebSphere MQ Adapter generates the UUID with a maximun length of 30 
     bytes. The UUID has no logical relation to the MsgId.
   - true, WebSphere MQ Adapter retains the existing behavior, which is also the
     default behavior in the absence of any setting.
   
   Note: The property name is case sensitive.

3. Click Save Changes.
   A key for the new property appears in the Extended Settings list.

4. Restart webMethods Integration Server for the changes to take effect.

For more information about the server configuration file and working with 
extended configuration settings, see "Administering webMethods Integration 
Server".

IMQ-919 (MQS_6.5_Fix15)
Next page indicator on WebSphere MQ Adapter connections page does not display 
correctly in Japanese environment.

When viewing adapter connections and there are more connections than can fit on 
a page, users can click "Next >>" to advance to additional pages. But in a 
Japanese environment, the character ">>" does not display correctly. This 
behavior is due to use of a UTF-8 compliant character for >>.

This issue is resolved. The >> character has been changed to use ISO-8859-1, and
the next page indicator now displays properly.

IMQ-916 (MQS_6.5_Fix15)
Cannot modify existing WebSphere MQ Adapter connections for SSL because there 
are no SSL-related connection parameters shown.

When configuring connections for WebSphere MQ Adapter, after enabling SSL by 
setting the property watt.WmMQAdapter.SSL.Support=true, new connections can be 
defined with SSL-related connection parameters. However, any existing non-SSL 
connections cannot be modified to add SSL, because the SSL-related parameters 
are not visible on the connection's properties.

This issue is resolved. SSL-related parameters will now be visible for existing 
connections as well as for new connections after setting the property 
watt.WmMQAdapter.SSL.Support=true.

IMQ-906 (MQS_6.5_Fix12)
JMS messages received with webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 using IBM 
WebSphere MQ 7.0 libraries do not pass on the MQMD header format, MQHRF2.

When a WebSphere MQ Adapter listener fetches JMS messages, it fails to pass on 
the MQHRF2 format for the MQMD header. The issue occurs only when using the IBM 
WebSphere MQ version 7.0 libraries.

This issue is resolved. A new server watt property,watt.WmMQAdapter.forceMQRFH2,
has been added that enables the adapter to force the MQHRF2 format for the MQMD 
header. To configure this property:

1. From the Integration Server Administrator, click Settings > Extended.

2. Click Edit Extended Settings. In the Extended Settings editor, type the 
   following:

   watt.WmMQAdapter.forceMQRFH2=<value>

     where <value> is true or false.

   Setting the parameter to true forces the WebSphere MQ Adapter listener to pass
   the MQHRF2 format for the MQMD header when fetching JMS messages.

   Setting the parameter to false (or deleting it from the Extended Settings 
   list)
   causes the adapter to not force the MQHRF2 format.

   Note: The parameter name is case sensitive.

3. Click Save Changes. A key for the new parameter appears in the Extended 
   Settings list.

4. Restart webMethods Integration Server for the changes to take effect.

For more information about the server configuration file and working with 
extended configuration settings, see the guide "Administering webMethods 
Integration Server".

IMQ-898 (MQS_6.5_Fix11)
Listener fails with MQRC 2033 when retrieving messages in a group from the queue,
and orphaned messages remain in the message queue.

With webMethods MQ Adapter 6.5, when a listener attempts to retrieve a message 
that is for a specific group from the queue, the operation is slow and fails 
with MQRC 2033. This code occurs when the messages are put into the queue as a 
group and the time frame in which the messages are put into the queue exceeds 
the "Wait Interval" property of the listener.

This behavior is as per design to stop the listener from fetching messages from 
the queue because messages were not found in the configured timeframe. However, 
when the listener fails, MQRC 2033 is thrown, and can cause orphaned messages 
when messages are put into the queue after the listener fails with a timeout.

This issue is resolved. A new listener parameter has been added to the Configure
Listener Type screen and the Edit Listener screen. The new parameter, "Retrieve 
only when all messages available," applies only to messages in a group.

- When set to True, the listener will not fetch messages from the queue until 
all messages that pertain to a group are present in the queue. (This is the new 
behavior.)

- When set to False (this is the default), the listener fetches messages when 
they arrive in the queue, even if not all messages in the group are in the queue.

IMQ-860 (MQS_6.5_Fix10)
Adapter notification fails when JMS property is empty.

When an adapter listener retrieves a WebSphere MQ message that contains empty 
XML structure in its MQRFH2 header the notification document published has the 
corresponding field missing.

WebSphere MQ messages can contain XML data in the MQRFH2 header, which the 
adapter parses and converts to Integration Server document format. However, 
WebSphere MQ Adapter does not correctly parse the empty XML structure of the 
form '</tag>', and the resulting notification document for the message has the
corresponding field missing. An error occurs during the publish of the document,
because all the fields of the notification document are mandatory.

This issue is resolved.

IMQ-852 (MQS_6-5_Fix9)
WebSphere MQ Adapter PUT service throws Java exception at run time.

When attempting to run a WebSphere MQ Adapter PUT service, the following error 
is thrown:
ADA.0600.1055 Exception caught action : RequestReply : Queue <queue> could not 
be opened for Output; com.ibm.mq.MQException: MQJE001: Completion Code 2, Reason
2035.MQJE001: Completion Code 2, Reason 2035 By default, the PUT adapter service
populates the 'putDateTime' field of the MQ message during execution. Because 
this field is populated by the adapter, IBM MQ Server requires the setall user
permission to be set in the MQ Queue Manager. However, giving setall permission 
may be seen as a security issue at some sites.

This issue is resolved. A new server watt property, 
watt.WmMQAdapter.Message.AddDateTimeStamp, has been added that enables the 
adapter to bypass populating the MQ message field 'putDateTime' field, thus 
setting the setall user permission is not required.

To configure the watt.WmMQAdapter.Message.AddDateTimeStamp property:

1. From the Integration Server Administrator, click Settings >  Extended.

2. Click Edit Extended Settings. In the Extended Settings editor, type the 
   following:

   watt.WmMQAdapter.Message.AddDateTimeStamp=<value>

     where <value> is true or false.

   Setting the parameter to true retains the existing behavior. That is, the 
   'putDateTime' field is implicitly set during PUT service execution. This is 
   the default.

   Setting the parameter to false bypasses setting the value for the 
   'putDateTime' field. That is, the 'putDateTime' field in the MQ message is 
   empty.

   Note: The parameter name is case sensitive.

3. Click Save Changes. A key for the new parameter appears in the Extended 
   Settings list.

4. Restart the webMethods Integration Server for the changes to take effect.

For more information about the server configuration file and working with 
extended configuration settings, see the webMethods Integration Server 
Administrator's Guide or Administering webMethods Integration Server.

1-1UQV4K (MQS_6-5_Fix8)
After a fatal error, Request/Reply service does not purge overridden ReplyTo 
connection.

When a fatal error occurs during the execution of a Request/Reply service whose 
ReplyTo connection properties are overridden, the service fails to recover from 
the error. The error persists even after the connection associated with this 
service is disabled and enabled again. This occurs because the Request/Reply 
service does not terminate and clean-up the stale overridden connection after
a fatal exception.

This issue is resolved.

1-1WMSHB (MQS_6-5_Fix8)
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException error is thrown when adapter service retrieves 
WebSphere MQ message containing repeated nested XML structures in its MQRFH2 
header.

WebSphere MQ messages can contain XML data in the MQRFH2 header which the adapter
parses and converts to Integration Server document format. However, the WebSphere
MQ Adapter code for XML parsing does not handle repeated nested XML structures 
correctly and an error is thrown.

This issue is resolved.

1-1WSOCD (MQS_6-5_Fix8)
Invoking the archive or clear tracing files services enables WebSphere MQ Adapter
tracing even when it is disabled.

When you run wm.mqseries.admin:archiveTraceFile or 
wm.mqseries.admin:clearTraceFile services, the WebSphere MQ client tracing is 
enabled even if the WebSphere MQ Trace Status is set to Disabled.

This issue is resolved.

1-1UVBK0 (MQS_6-5_Fix7)
WebSphere MQ Adapter does not create the child listener when the associated 
queue name contains special characters.

When creating a multi-queue listener, the adapter does not create the child 
listeners when the associated queue name contains special characters like '.',
'%' and '/'.

This issue is resolved. Now when creating a multi-queue listener, if a queue name
contains special characters, the adapter successfully creates the child listeners
for the associated queues. The child listeners are named after the queue they 
listen to, prefixed by the parent multi-queue listener name provided, but the 
special characters are replaced with underscores ('_').

1-1U19ZZ (MQS_6-5_Fix6)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter services fail to recover from the errors when 
the override connection parameters are invalid.

At runtime the WebSphere MQ Adapter enables you to override the default 
connection parameters associated with an adapter service. However, if you specify
invalid values for the host name, port, or channel connection parameters, 
subsequent invocations of the adapter service fail, even after specifying valid 
values. This error occurs because the adapter does not revert to the original 
connection parameter values after encountering an error in overridden parameters.

This issue is resolved. WebSphere MQ Adapter now restores the connection 
parameters after you provide the original connection parameters, and subsequent 
invocations of the adapter service complete successfully.

1-1RWSM4 (MQS_6-5_Fix5)
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 does not support IBM Coded Character Set 
Identifier (CCSID) 1200 character encoding.

In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5, GET and PEEK services return an empty 
'msgBody' field when msgHeader.CodedCharSetId field is set to "1200" or "CP1200".
This is because webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 does not support messages 
with UTF-16 character encoding. CCSID 1200 represents UTF-16 character encoding.

This issue is resolved. webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 now supports IBM 
Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) 1200 character encoding.

1-1KQMJN (MQS_6-5_Fix4)
The WebSphere MQ Server fails to send COD (Confirmation On Delivery) report 
messages when CorrelId or MsgId is specified in the MQMD header or UserId is 
specified in the WebSphere MQ Adapter connection properties.

In WebSphere MQ Adapter, when the messages are put using the 'PUT' service and 
the COD acknowledgement is enabled for that message, WebSphere MQ Server fails 
to send COD report messages when CorrelId or MsgId is specified in the MQMD 
header or UserId is specified in the WebSphere MQ Adapter connection properties.

This issue is now resolved. The WebSphere MQ Server will send COD report messages
even when CorrelId or MsgId is specified in the MQMD header or UserID is 
specified in the WebSphere MQ Adapter connection properties.

1-1M5TO3 (MQS_6-5_Fix3)
When you create a "Put" service in WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5 without selecting a 
JMSType from the "JMS Properties" tab, the message header contains 
<Type>jms_text</Type> tag.

By default, the <Type>jms_text</Type> tag is present in the message header of 
the "Put" service. This is happening for messages having RFH2 header. The <Type>
tag is inserted in the MQ message, even if the "JMSProperties.jms.JMSType" is 
not selected in "JMS Properties" tab.

The issue is now resolved. The <Type> tag will be inserted in the MQ message 
only if the "JMSProperties.jms.JMSType" is selected in the "JMS Properties" tab 
while creating the service.

Note: The property watt.MQSeries.Suppress.JMSType.tag is no longer used in 
webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter 6.5.

1-1IW7O9 (MQS_6-5_Fix2)
When JMS application puts a message into WebSphere MQ queue, WebSphere MQ Adapter
notification throws an error with the following error code: ADA.600.1007.

WebSphere MQ Adapter notification throws an error when trying to read messages 
from WebSphere MQ queue. This issue happens only when the message put into the 
queue by JMS application has a null value in the "JMS Type" header field.

This issue is now resolved. The WebSphere MQ Adapter Notification and GET 
service can now handle WebSphere MQ messages with null values in the "JMS Type"
header field.

1-153LVB (MQS_6-5_Fix1)
WebSphere MQ Adapter throws a Null Pointer Exception when you invoke a Get, Peek,
or Request/Reply service.

When a Get, Peek, or Request/Reply service retrieves a message with RFH 1 Header,
a Null Pointer exception occurs while parsing the header. WebSphere MQ Adapter 
handles only messages with RFH 2 Headers and the RFH 2 header values are put in
the corresponding JMS header fields.

This issue is resolved. If a message in WebSphere MQ queue is having RFH 1 Header,
the Get, Peek, or Request/Reply services will ignore the header and treat the 
message as a normal message. The RFH 1 header values will be present in the 
message body.

1-1BVR53 (MQS_6-5_Fix1)
In webMethods WebSphere MQ Adapter, the logging of MQJE messages cannot be 
controlled.

WebSphere MQ client directs all the MQJE messages to the console or to a log 
file. This will result in a large amount of log data, especially when a listener
is running.

This issue is now resolved. A new watt property
'watt.WmMQAdapter.Log.MQJE.ExcludeList' is added. You can use
this watt property to control the logging of MQJE messages by
setting the following values:
1) 'NONE' (Default behavior): Logs all the MQJE messages.
2) 'ALL': Will not log any MQJE messages.
3) Specific Reason codes separated by comma: The messages of the
specified reason codes will not be logged.

1-150GZN (MQS_6-5_Fix1)
When putting a message into the queue using the Put service, the adapter ignores
the Put Time and Put Date specified at the runtime.

The "Put Date" and "Put Time" fields present in MQ header are by default 
populated with the current date and time. You can also override the values of 
Put Date and Put Time at runtime. The values specified at the runtime are 
currently not set to the corresponding fields in the MQ message header.

This issue is resolved. The Put Date and Put Time should be specified in GMT. 
The format for Put Date should be 'YYYYMMDD' where 'YYYY' is the year, 'MM' is 
the month ('00' for Jan and '11' for Dec) and 'DD' is the date.

The format for Put Time is 'HHMMSSTT', where 'HH' is hour, 'MM' is minutes, 'SS'
is seconds, and 'TT' is 1/100th of a second.
