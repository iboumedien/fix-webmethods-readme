Server-side validation is added for the file upload functionality in CentraSite.
The file upload fails if the file size is above the set limit(default 100 MB)
or the file is a binary (with mime type "application/octet-stream").

The maximum file size limit can be set in one of the config.xml files:
<CentraSiteInstall_Directory>/cast/cswebapps/BusinessUI/custom/conf/
centrasite.xml
<CentraSiteInstall_Directory>/cast/cswebapps/BusinessUI/system/conf/
centrasite.xml

Add the <FileUploadSettings maxUploadfileSize="" /> inside the UIProperties
tag.

For example:

<GUIConfiguration>
    ...
    <UIProperties>
        ...

        <FileUploadSettings maxUploadfileSize="104857600" />

        ...
    </UIProperties>
