NUM-19535 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix13)

After exporting a Universal Messaging realm configuration with several joins that connect a channel 
to channel/queue within the same realm, the joins do not get recreated correctly when imported in a 
realm: only the first join is recreated successfully in the target realm.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19292 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix13)

Creation of an interface when there is an existing interface with the same port was allowed.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-19128 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix12)

When we are deleting the durable, we are deregistering and removing all the viewers and panels 
attached to a nDurable object, before deleting the actual object.

NUM-19065 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix11)

The Universal Messaging TraceStores realm configuration property in Enterprise Manager is not 
updated correctly.
You cannot remove the names of all the stores specified in the TraceStores configuration property. 
At least one store that you cannot delete remains specified.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18812 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix10)

An additional console opens when you start Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18456 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix7)

When you export a realm configuration in an xml file using Enterprise Manager, Universal Messaging 
wrongly appends "@" at the end of a join destination.
The issue occurs when the source channel in a join has a namespace.
This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-18351 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix7)

The WarningThreshold realm configuration parameter is missing from Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved. The WarningThreshold has been added back to Enterprise Manager. You can 
configure the parameter as part of the Basic Configuration category on the Config tab.

NUM-18198 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix6)

The Top Channel Usage tab in Enterprise Manager does not display the rate of consumed and published 
events.
Instead, the tab displays only the total number of consumed and published events.
The issue is resolved. The tab now displays both the rate and total number of consumed and published 
events.

NUM-14794 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix6)

Newly added servers to an existing Universal Messaging cluster cannot establish
inter-realm communication between each other.
In Enterprise Manager, when you add more than one realm server to an existing Universal Messaging 
cluster at the same time, the newly added servers cannot establish
inter-realm communication between each other.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17547 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix4)

EM was showing internal session ID related information as connection key in the durable tab for 
indexed durables. This prevented end users from finding potentially slow or stuck consumers to 
bounce. The fix is to display IP:Port SessionID formatted key instead of internal session ID info 
so that client connections could be identified in EM and bounced. 

NUM-17502 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix4)

Protobuf descriptor missing after channel edit
When editing the storage properties of a store, the protobuf properties might get lost in the 
process.
The issue is resolved

NUM-17698 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix3)

Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager might not update the Filter field for a durable.
When you edit the filter for a durable, Enterprise Manager might not display the updated value in 
the Filter field in the Durables table. The correct value is displayed only after you restart 
Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17476 (NUM_10.11_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix2)

The following enhancements have been added to the Universal Messaging ExportProtobufDefinitions 
command-line tool:
 - The name format of the exported Protobuf descriptors has been changed to 
descriptor_{id}_{descriptorName}. For an unnamed descriptor, the format is descriptor_{id}.
 - The tool now checks if the exported file name is valid. If the name contains an invalid symbol, 
the exported file is named "InvalidName".
 - When you export Protobuf descriptors for a store, the tool creates a folder that has the same 
name as the store, if such a folder does not exist. If the folder already exists, it must be empty. 
The tool will fail to export the descriptors if the folder has any content.


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.
(*) Starting with 10.11 Fix 3, Universal Messaging provides updated versions of security libraries with 
the Universal Messaging realm server fixes, if any of these libraries has been updated. You can find 
the libraries in the UniversalMessaging\lib folder.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix, 
please shut down any applications such as Integration Server 
or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager 
fix, you do not need to shut down the Universal Messaging server.

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager or 
Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions, see the 
corresponding documentation 
at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the 
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your 
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot 
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was not 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this fix has
no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported 
locale or configuration.



10.1 Localization

This fix does not require an updated Language Pack. It might contain new 
messages and these messages will appear in English.
