allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data 
in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). 
By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an 
attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in 
versions 30.0 and later and should not be used.

NUM-19730 (NUM_10.11_PlatformManagerPlugins_Fix2)

Command Central always displays JKS keystore and truststore certificate types for
Universal Messaging NSPS and NHPS ports, regardless of the certificate type you select.

After you select and provide a PKCS12 certificate file, the Command Central web user 
interface displays the certificate type as JKS. In addition, the tooltip incorrectly
states that the only supported certificate type is JKS.

The issue is resolved.

using a Command Central template fails.

template and create the interface.

The issue is now resolved.
