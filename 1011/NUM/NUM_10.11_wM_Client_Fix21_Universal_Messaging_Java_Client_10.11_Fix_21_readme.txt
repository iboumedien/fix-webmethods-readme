NUM-23276 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix21)

After a Universal Messaging Realm restarts, the number of current connections might be incorrect 
because of a memory leak. The issue occurs if a subscription was removed while the realm was down.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-23187 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix21)

In a slow environment, a Universal Messaging (UM) server might delay sending a keepalive response to 
a UM client, which could disconnect the client.
The issue is resolved. You can use a new UM client-side property, 
"com.softwareag.um.client.server_keep_alive_leeway", to specify the additional time it can take a 
UM server to reply to a keepalive sent by a UM client. The default value is 15 seconds. You can 
increase the keepalive leeway if the UM server is under heavy load that might cause a delay in the 
keepalive reply. Such a delay can sometimes disconnect UM clients, so you have the option to 
increase the allowed delay before a client closes a connection due to a failed keepalive.
For more information about working with client properties, see the Universal Messaging 
documentation.

NUM-21793 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix20)

Improved logging when different threads try to close an http connection simultaneously in a 
Universal Messaging client.

NUM-20273 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix19)

During network latency, the Universal Messaging NHP and NHPS communication drivers might not perform 
optimally, which might result in many network events queueing on the client side.
When the client encounters network latency and with enough concurrent requests in a request-reply 
scenario, the server's NHP and NHPS drivers are overwhelmed when using the default configuration.
The issue is resolved. Logging has been enhanced and the max buffer size of the drivers has been 
increased from 10 KB to 100 MB when a request is sent. When you set the 
'com.softwareag.um.client.write_handler' client property
to 'queue' each request is filled before being sent.
In addition, you can use the following new client properties to change the default behavior of the 
communication drivers in case of network delays and to enhance logging:
com.softwareag.um.client.MaximumContentLengthPerHTTPRequest=<bytes>
Specifies the maximum number of bytes that a single HTTP request can send. Default is 103809024, or 
99 MB in bytes.
com.softwareag.um.client.EventSerializationTimeLoggingThreshold=<milliseconds>
Specifies a threshold in milliseconds beyond which the client writes a log message to help find 
network delays. The measurement is taken while serializing an event into bytes. Default is 1000 
milliseconds.
com.softwareag.um.client.NetworkFlushTimeLoggingThreshold=<milliseconds>
Specifies a threshold in milliseconds beyond which the client writes a log message to help find 
network delays during OutputStream flush calls. The measurement is taken while calling the 
highest-level flush and an additional
log message is produced in the lowest area where multiple flush calls could be executed. Default is 
5000 milliseconds.
com.softwareag.um.client.OutboundQueueSizeLoggingThreshold=<number_of_events>
Specifies a threshold beyond which the client writes a
log message to help find queued network events waiting to be sent by the client. This indicates an 
upcoming timeout on requests and potentially timed-out requests due to the client not receiving a 
reply from the server. Default is 50 events.
com.softwareag.um.client.MarkTimedOutEventDeleted=true|false
Changes the behavior when the client sends a synchronous request, if the request times out on the 
client side before it is sent. In this case, the event is deleted, which can result in quicker 
recovery of a bad state and in not sending superfluous data. Default is 'true'.
For more information about setting client properties, see the Universal Messaging documentation.

NUM-12619 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix19)

On the Windows platform JVM's do not support millisecond resolution when using the 
java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport#parkNanos methods causing delays up to 15 milliseconds when 
expecting only 1 millisecond. A solution has been implemented that overcomes this issue by enabling 
1 millisecond clock resolution with the use of java.lang.Thread#sleep(long) on a thread for the 
life of the JVM.

NUM-18958 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix17)

OpenSSL is upgraded to 1.1.1.u version

NUM-20080 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix16)

NA

NUM-20132 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix16)

Universal Messaging uses the Guava library version 30.1.1, which has a security vulnerability.
The issue is resolved. The Guava library has been updated to version 32.1.1.

NUM-20372 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix15)

The Universal Messaging RealmInformationCollector (RIC) tool fails to export the realm configuration 
of a cluster in live mode when the cluster is not formed and a JNDI context is present.
The tool returns the exception "Failed to execute 'realmconfig' collector, reason: Failed to export 
realm configuration for instance: <instance>". The issue occurs because the export of the JNDI 
event set fails.
The issue is resolved. Now the RIC tool ignores the export of the JNDI event set and exports the 
realm configuration.

NUM-20214 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix15)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party Xerces library used in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved. The Xerces jar used in Universal Messaging has been upgraded to version 
2.12.1 from versions 2.11 and 2.3.

NUM-19890 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix15)

Using JMX, you can monitor only one Universal Messaging HTTP-SocketAccept or
HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pool at a time and you cannot identify which thread
pool you are monitoring.
Out of many existing HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pools,
you can monitor only one at a time using JMX and it is not clear which one it is.
The JMX monitoring tool just displays the generic name HTTP-SocketAccept.
The issue happens because the socket accept thread pool name does not include
the name of the corresponding Universal Messaging interface and the JMX server
cannot identify the different thread pools.
The issue is resolved. Now each HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread
pool name includes the name of the corresponding interface, for example,
HTTP-SocketAccept-nhp1, and all thread pools are visible and identifiable in your
JMX monitoring tool.

NUM-19782 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix14)

Before the fix, user is unable to create/Delete the site in Enterprise Manager -> Cluster -> Sites 
tab. Site tab did not display the Site details if the sites are already present.
After this fix, User will be able to create/delete the Site from Enterprise Manager. The Site 
details will also be displayed in Enterprise Manager Site panel if the site details are present

NUM-19854 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix14)

The Universal Messaging server and Java client now log additional diagnostic information when thread 
pool monitoring reports a slow or stalled task.
Additional information is logged for slow or stalled tasks in the following cases:
- A slow or stalled channel listener task in the Java client. The thread pool monitoring logs the 
channel name and the size of the incoming event queue.
- A slow connection accept task in the server. The thread pool monitoring logs the connection 
details (IP address and port), the type of the client, and connection statistics for the respective 
network interface.
- A slow connection read task in the server. The thread pool monitoring logs the connection details 
(IP address and port), and also minimum, maximum, and current response times for the connection.

NUM-19725 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix14)

The following issues are observed in Universal Messaging: 
- NullPointerException when auto-acknowledging events for queues.
- Leaked asynchronous queue connection readers retaining pending events for a queue.
- Continuous rollback of events for a queue.
These issues are resolved.

NUM-19808 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix14)

The healthchecker collector of the RealmInformationCollector command-line tool executes slowly in a 
Universal Messaging cluster with many channels and durables.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19748 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix14)

The runUMTool ClusterState tool does not give information about offline nodes in a UM server 
cluster.
ClusterState tool is modified for including the information of nodes that are offline or not 
connected to the active cluster nodes.
Also, ClusterTool is enhanced with some additional information of the cluster members.

NUM-19535 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix13)

After exporting a Universal Messaging realm configuration with several joins that connect a channel 
to channel/queue within the same realm, the joins do not get recreated correctly when imported in a 
realm: only the first join is recreated successfully in the target realm.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19292 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix13)

Creation of an interface when there is an existing interface with the same port was allowed.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-19375 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix13)

Adding or modifying supported ciphers for a Universal Messaging server SSL interface using 
command-line tools might fail.
When you run the AddHTTPSInterface, AddSSLInterface, or ModifyInterface command-line tools and 
specify the 'ciphers' optional parameter, the tools might fail to execute, although the specified 
ciphers are part of the list of supported SSL ciphers. Adding a cipher might fail with the 
following error: "Illegal argument passed: Cipher not found in supported cipher list".
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19301 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix13)

When Integration Server uses Universal Messaging as a JMS provider, it might stop responding when 
you try to enable or disable JMS triggers.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19214 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix13)

Previously we could have a situation when a session got the channel attribute protobuf descriptors 
cached and not get it updated when channel protobuf descriptors were updated from any other 
session.
Now it is fixed and protobuf descriptors are getting updated in cache of any connected sessions.

NUM-19252 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix13)

Enterprise Manager displays invalid realm property values imported from an XML realm configuration 
file using the ninstancemanager command-line tool.
After you import a realm configuration from an XML file using ninstancemanager and the configuration 
contains invalid realm property values, Universal Messaging might not automatically replace the 
invalid values with valid ones on start-up. As a result, Enterprise Manager displays the invalid 
property values, which could lead to exceptions and unexpected behavior of Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved. 

NUM-19128 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix12)

When we are deleting the durable, we are deregistering and removing all the viewers and panels 
attached to a nDurable object, before deleting the actual object.

NUM-18880 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix12)

A Universal Messaging client might take a long time to detect a connection failure.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging keep-alive performance has been optimized for improved 
detection of broken socket connections.
For all nSession clients, each client will now check for the reception of a server-side keep alive. 
Note that you configure server-side keep-alive intervals by setting the "KeepAlive" realm 
configuration property under "Connection Config" in Enterprise Manager. If this keep alive is not 
received on time, the session is closed, and a reconnection attempt is made. Also note that 
reconnections can be disabled at an API level.
In addition, you can use a new Java system property, com.softwareag.um.client.missed_keep_alives=<n> 
to set the number of missed server-side keep alives before a connection is closed.
Java system property reference
com.softwareag.um.client.missed_keep_alives=<n>
Specifies the number of missed server-side keep alives before a connection is closed. The default 
value is 1. A value of 1 means that if a single keep alive is missed by the client, the session is 
closed. To disable server-side keep alive checking, set the Java property to 0 (zero).
Note that the Java property is consulted only once upon JVM startup.
Important: If you experience issues with lost connections or duplicate messages after applying this 
fix, particularly with multiplexed sessions, you should adjust the value of 
"com.softwareag.um.client.missed_keep_alives". To resolve such issues, Software AG recommends that 
you first set the property to a value greater than or equal to two. However, if the issues persist 
after some time, disable the fix altogether by setting the property value to zero.
For more information, see the Universal Messaging Java API documentation on:
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nConstants#setPermittedKeepAlivesMissed
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nConstants.MISSED_KEEP_ALIVES
For more information about the "KeepAlive" realm configuration property, see the Universal Messaging 
Administration Guide.

NUM-19065 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix11)

The Universal Messaging TraceStores realm configuration property in Enterprise Manager is not 
updated correctly.
You cannot remove the names of all the stores specified in the TraceStores configuration property. 
At least one store that you cannot delete remains specified.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18339 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix11)

A Universal Messaging Java client fails to connect to the server when the hostname of the server or 
of the machine that hosts the server contains special characters, such as an underscore.
The issue occurs because the Java URI API does not support special characters in hostnames.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18812 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix10)

An additional console opens when you start Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16652 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix10)

In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61, attackers can obtain sensitive information about a 
private exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs. This occurs in 
org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding. Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short 
payload in the OAEP Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially leaking 
some information about the private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption.
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26939
CVSS Score: 5.3 Medium

NUM-16651 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix10)

A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with 
access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API 
com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory 
is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has 
been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used.
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8908
CVSS Score: 3.3 Low
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-18668 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix8)

When you enable the ThreadDumpOnSlowTask thread-pool monitoring property, Universal Messaging might 
generate many thread dumps over a short time, which could slow performance.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18421 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix8)

Universal Messaging might log thread dumps twice in nirvana.log.
When a stalled or slow moving task is detected, or a thread dump is requested, it might be logged 
twice in nirvana.log which is unnecessary.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18456 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix7)

When you export a realm configuration in an xml file using Enterprise Manager, Universal Messaging 
wrongly appends "@" at the end of a join destination.
The issue occurs when the source channel in a join has a namespace.
This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-18351 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix7)

The WarningThreshold realm configuration parameter is missing from Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved. The WarningThreshold has been added back to Enterprise Manager. You can 
configure the parameter as part of the Basic Configuration category on the Config tab.

NUM-18469 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix7)

Connecting to Universal Messaging from an OSGi application might fail because the Universal 
Messaging OSGi nClient.jar library forces you to install log4j-related jars even though they are 
not used.
The issue occurs because the log4j jars in the nClient.jar library have been added as mandatory 
import packages.
The issue is resolved. The log4j-related jars in nClient.jar have been changed to optional import 
packages.

NUM-18324 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix7)

"After you install Universal Messaging 10.11 Fix 4, disabling Network Input/Output (NIO) on a realm 
interface might result in the server disconnecting all clients.
When you use Universal Messaging with NIO disabled on an interface, the server disconnects all 
clients in five minutes, which is the default value for the IdleDriverTimeout connection 
configuration. Before the connection is lost, Universal Messaging logs several "Monitor>Inactive 
driver on adapter" messages in the nirvana.log file.
The issue is now resolved."

NUM-17926 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix7)

Universal Messaging uses the OpenSSL 1.1.1n C++ third-party library, which is vulnerable to 
CVE-2022-1292.
The issue is resolved. The OpenSSL 1.1.1n C++ library has been replaced with OpenSSL 1.1.1o.

NUM-18198 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix6)

The Top Channel Usage tab in Enterprise Manager does not display the rate of consumed and published 
events.
Instead, the tab displays only the total number of consumed and published events.
The issue is resolved. The tab now displays both the rate and total number of consumed and published 
events.

NUM-14794 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix6)

Newly added servers to an existing Universal Messaging cluster cannot establish
inter-realm communication between each other.
In Enterprise Manager, when you add more than one realm server to an existing Universal Messaging 
cluster at the same time, the newly added servers cannot establish
inter-realm communication between each other.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17919 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix6)

Universal Messaging clients might fail to receive large messages of type JMS MapMessage.
The client might return a NullPointerException when the message payload or
key exceeds one million bytes.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17026 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix6)

Setting the log level of a Universal Messaging Java client to "Error" might result in many session 
establishment and closure messages in the Universal Messaging client log file, which makes the logs 
hard to read and might cause disk space issues over time.
The issue is resolved. Session establishment and closure messages are now logged at the ?Info? 
level.

NUM-17862 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix6)

Universal Messaging uses the OpenSSL 1.1.1l C++ third-party library, which is vulnerable to 
CVE-2022-0778.
The issue is resolved. The OpenSSL 1.1.1l C++ library has been replaced with OpenSSL 1.1.1n.

NUM-17547 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix4)

EM was showing internal session ID related information as connection key in the durable tab for 
indexed durables. This prevented end users from finding potentially slow or stuck consumers to 
bounce. The fix is to display IP:Port SessionID formatted key instead of internal session ID info 
so that client connections could be identified in EM and bounced. 

NUM-17502 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix4)

Protobuf descriptor missing after channel edit
When editing the storage properties of a store, the protobuf properties might get lost in the 
process.
The issue is resolved

NUM-17744 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix4)

A Universal Messaging client might get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception when the customer 
is doing an Async connection and he is trying to close the reader at the same time.
We have put synchronization on closing async consumers. 
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15970 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix4)

When nProtobuf events get published from a Universal Messaging server to the client, the events are 
not processed in the correct order. The issue occurs because the custom Protobuf attributes are not 
set in the nProtobuf events.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17698 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix3)

Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager might not update the Filter field for a durable.
When you edit the filter for a durable, Enterprise Manager might not display the updated value in 
the Filter field in the Durables table. The correct value is displayed only after you restart 
Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17640 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix3)

When using NSPS protocol (nsp over SSL) for inter-cluster commmunication, Universal Messaging master 
realm may lockup when writing data to another realm in the cluster if the connection to that realm 
is interrupted. The lockup may prevent the cluster keep alive check to reset the connection and may 
cause the master realm to remain stuck even after the rest of the cluster reforms and elects 
another master.
This issue is now resolved. Universal Messaging server no longer holds any locks when closing an 
inter-realm connection, which enables cluster keep alive handling to close non-responsive 
connections immediately.

NUM-17476 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix2)

The following enhancements have been added to the Universal Messaging ExportProtobufDefinitions 
command-line tool:
 - The name format of the exported Protobuf descriptors has been changed to 
descriptor_{id}_{descriptorName}. For an unnamed descriptor, the format is descriptor_{id}.
 - The tool now checks if the exported file name is valid. If the name contains an invalid symbol, 
the exported file is named "InvalidName".
 - When you export Protobuf descriptors for a store, the tool creates a folder that has the same 
name as the store, if such a folder does not exist. If the folder already exists, it must be empty. 
The tool will fail to export the descriptors if the folder has any content.

NUM-17174 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix2)

The Universal Messaging RealmInformationCollector diagnostic tool might fail while
collecting information about the operating system.
The issue occurs due to failure in the old Oshi library that the tool uses.
The issue is resolved. The Oshi-Core, JNA, and JNA-Platform libraries have been upgraded to the 
latest version.

NUM-16909 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix1)

The Universal Messaging JMS MessageConsumerImpl.receiveCacheReturnOutstandingRequests() API and 
similarly named APIs in the Universal Messaging Java client's nQueueSyncReader and nChannelIterator 
classes do not function correctly and may return duplicate events. 
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-16840 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix1)

A Universal Messaging client might write a NullPointerException in its logs when deleting the 
connection from one Universal Messaging realm to another, and the same admin session (nRealmNode) 
is being closed simultaneously.
For example, the issue might occur when you remove a Universal Messaging server from a zone.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16546 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix1)

Universal Messaging clients might wait indefinitely to establish a connection to the server.
Clients might wait indefinitely in an SSL handshake when the network is unstable.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15762 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix1)

Universal Messaging client-side logging has been enhanced for better troubleshooting of connection 
establishment issues.

NUM-16946 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix1)

Security vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL version 1.1.1k.
The issue is resolved. The OpenSSL version used in Universal Messaging has been upgraded from 1.1.1k 
to 1.1.1l.

NUM-15346 (NUM_10.11_wM_Client_Fix1)

The Universal Messaging DeleteJoin command-line tool cannot find an inter-cluster join between two 
cluster-wide channels.
This issue is now resolved.


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.
(*) Starting with 10.11 Fix 3, Universal Messaging provides updated versions of security libraries with 
the Universal Messaging realm server fixes, if any of these libraries has been updated. You can find 
the libraries in the UniversalMessaging\lib folder.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix, 
please shut down any applications such as Integration Server 
or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager 
fix, you do not need to shut down the Universal Messaging server.

Uninstall using the IBM webMethods Update Manager or 
Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions, see the 
corresponding documentation 
at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the 
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your 
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot 
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the IBM webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was not 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this fix has
no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported 
locale or configuration.



10.1 Localization

This fix does not require an updated Language Pack. It might contain new 
messages and these messages will appear in English.
