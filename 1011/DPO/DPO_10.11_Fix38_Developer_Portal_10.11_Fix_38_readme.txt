A vulnerable version of the third-party component, cxf-core, is used.

This issue is now resolved. The mentioned JAR is upgraded to version 3.5.9.


DPO-6010 (Fix 35)
Registration form - First letter in the placeholder text is not capitalized.

When you, as an administrator, provide the placeholder text for any custom field 
of the Sign up page in camel case, then the first letter of the placeholders
appear in lowercase.

This issue is now resolved.


DPO-5295 (Fix 34)
Unable to edit applications.

When an application has only API key details, and if you edit that application
then the application is not updated as expected.

This issue is now resolved. 


DPO-5383 (Fix 33)
Security vulnerabilities and exposures in Developer Portal!

The specified changes are made to the following two endpoints:

- /portal/rest/v1/passwordpolicy - Does not return the advanced configuration 
   details.
- /portal/rest/v1/prometheus - Exposed only to cloud instances. For on-prem, 
   this endpoint will return 404 in UI and 200 with 404 HTML content in the 
   REST client.

DPO-4360 (Fix 33)
Versions of some third-party components are vulnerable.

This issue is now resolved. The versions of the following JARs are upgraded:

* spring-security-core to 5.8.12 version
* spring-web to 5.3.34 version
* esapi to 2.5.3.1 version
* commons-compress to 1.26.1 version


DPO-4156 (Fix 32)
OAuth token expiry label is not in synchronization with API Gateway.

Validity of OAuth tokens expiry is displayed in milliseconds in the 'Applications details' 
page of the Developer Portal, whereas API Gateway displays this value in seconds.

This issue is now resolved.


DPO-3963 (Fix 31)
The request body parameter not working as expected when a file is uploaded.

When an API endpoint redirects the request to another endpoint, Developer Portal
displays the 302 response code instead of the correct response code.

This issue is now resolved.

DPO-4064 (Fix 31)
Access of protected pages to users without any role.

When you have enabled an approval workflow for user onboarding, and if a user
onboards, Developer Portal creates the profile for that user without any role.
The corresponding roles are assigned to the users after the onboarding approval.
In such a scenario, if the newly onboarded user signs in and navigates to the
"Manage applications" page some static data appears instead of the
"404-Not found" page. Also, the user could search for other users without any
role and share applications with them.

This issue is now resolved. When users without any role access Developer
Portal and navigate to any protected page, then the "404-Not found" page
appears. Also, other users cannot share applications with these
users (without any role).

DPO-4042 (Fix 31)

longer than the response time taken when you attempt with a non-existing user
name. Hence, these attempts allow potential user enumeration.

This issue is now resolved.


DPO-3890 (Fix 30)
Version of the third party component, Logback, is vulnerable.

This issue is now resolved. The versions of the Logback-classic and Logback core 
jars are upgraded to 1.2.13.

DPO-3412 (Fix 30)
User enumeration is possible based on a failed error message during sign in.

Since different error messages are displayed for a valid user versus an invalid user 
after certain failed sign in attempts, user enumeration could be performed.

This issue is now resolved. A generic error message is displayed for all failed 
sign in attempts.

DPO-3762 (Fix 30)
Versions of few third party components are vulnerable.

This issue is now resolved. The versions of the following JARs are upgraded:

 * JOSE4j to 0.9.3 version
 * JSON to 20231013.0.0 version
 * ESAPI to 2.5.2.0 version
 * Elasticsearch to 7.17.15 version
 * Reactor Netty HTTP to 1.1.13 version
 * Netty-handler (also all netty jars) to 4.1.100 version
 
DPO-3843 (Fix 30)
SOAP API description is not displayed properly.

If a SOAP API has no definition, then the description is displayed as a summary 
of that API in the API gallery page.

SOAP APIs is not displayed. The description is truncated according to the 
length of the description column in the API details grid based on your 
screen resolution. 

This issue is now resolved. The Manage API and Community details pages now 
display the description with ellipses at the end indicating that it is not 
the complete description. You can view the complete text by clicking the 
corresponding API name.

DPO-3876 (Fix 30)

section, 'None' is selected by default.

This issue is now resolved. 'Raw' is selected by default. 

DPO-3873 (Fix 30)

the reason for rejection.


DPO-2638 (Fix 27)

configured onboarding approval workflow.

This issue is now resolved.

DPO-2735 (Fix 27)

UAE Pass.Due to this, they are automatically logged in during consecutive sessions.

This issue is now resolved. You must enable this feature by specifying the UAE 
logout URL in the following variable in the 'dpo_wrapper' config file located in 
SAGInstallDir\profiles\CTP\configuration:

wrapper.java.additional.2201=-Dcom.softwareag.portal.oauth.uaepass.logout.url=<uae_pass_logout_url>

verification. 

The 'Verify hostname' option is removed from the UI. Hence, to enable the

of this setting is 'true'.

DPO-2303 (Fix 23)
