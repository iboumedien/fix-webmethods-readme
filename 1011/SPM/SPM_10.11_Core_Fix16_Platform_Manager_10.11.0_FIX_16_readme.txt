5.0 Platform Support

The fix is supported on all platforms supported by 
Software AG Command Central 10.11.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

None.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.


CCE-8477
When you export an instance in Command Central, the string "Picked" is appended 
to some of the lines in the template. Applying such a template might fail because 
of the appended string.

The issue is resolved. The string "Picked" is no longer appended to any line in the template.


SPM-5555
Command Central and Platform Manager might stop working after installing the 
following fix for the webMethods Shared Third Party Bundles: wMFix.TPS.XMLTools_10.5.0.0002.

The issue is resolved. 


SPM-5542
Upgrading Platform Manager to version 10.11 might fail if the source Platform
Manager has been modified to use the Entrust encryption.

The issue is resolved. You can now upgrade a source Platform Manager that uses 
the Entrust encryption to version 10.11. The required libraries for the Entrust 
encryption are now added to the migration framework in Platform Manager.


SPM-5482
After creating or updating a Platform Manager HTTPs port configuration using 
the Command Central webuser interface, the configured keystore password is 
included in plain text in the Platform Manager wrapper.log file.

The issue is resolved. The keystore password entry is no longer included in 
the Platform Manager wrapper.log.


CCE-7790
Command Central assets build might fail with a NoClassDefFoundError exception.
The issue is resolved.


CCE-7562
MWS migration via Side-by-Side Stack Upgrade is failing with inappropriate message, 
if the db password is an empty string or encrypted string which actual value is an empty string.

The issue is resolved from CC side. When we provide an empty string or encrypted string 
which actual value is an empty string, then these parameters are not passed to the migration utility. 
The migration utility also requires changes which will be handled in some of the future fixes.


CCE-7621
When listing the dependencies of a fix in а repository from the Command Central Web User Interface, 
the fix dependencies for the fix fail to load with an exception.

The issue is resolved. Аfter you select the operating system, the Show Dependencies 
dialog loads the fix dependencies correctly.


CCE-7586
When installing fixes using Command Central, Platform Manager stops all runtime components 
that require shutdown.

The issue is resolved. A parameter setting is provided that skips shutdown for passed runtimes.


SPM-5394
When applying a snapshot template on Platform Manager, fixes may not be reinstalled 
on the newly created instance.

Applying a snapshot template on Platform Manager may result in a fix not being reinstalled 
on the newly created instance.
This occurs when the fixes for provisioning are resolved against the products defined in the 
template instead of being resolved against the new instance.

The issue is resolved. Platform Manager now resolves the fixes against the newly created instance.


CCE-7071 
In Command Central, when upgrading a stack or executing a dry run for a stack upgrade,
the operation might fail with the following error message at the template validation step:
“Un-handled internal server error. Internal error: handler not loaded for this platform (<platform>)
caused by: com.softwareag.platform.management.common.exceptions.PlatformManagerException”

The issue is now resolved.

10.0 Globalization

webMethods product suite and includes support for operation in
any country, locale, or language as specified in the Installing
webMethods Products guide. It was not tested with non-English
configurations and non-ASCII data. This fix may have some
globalization impact.
