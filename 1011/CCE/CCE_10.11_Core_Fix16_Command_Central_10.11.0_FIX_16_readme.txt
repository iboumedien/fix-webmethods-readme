7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.

CCE-8353
Software AG Command Central uses an outdated version of the
third party component Apache Xmlgraphics batik, which has known security vulnerabilities.

The issue is resolved. The Apache Xmlgraphics batik jar is migrated to the stable version 1.17.


CCE-8226
You can now reduce the Command Central cache by updating the disk compaction 
policy that Command Central uses. For more information, see 
the "Command Central Cache Takes too Much Disk Space" topic in the Command Central help.

SPM-5555
Command Central and Platform Manager might stop working after installing the 
following fix for the webMethods Shared Third Party Bundles: wMFix.TPS.XMLTools_10.5.0.0002.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-8202
Upgrading Command Central to version 10.11 might fail if the source Command Central 
has been modified to use the Entrust encryption.

The issue is resolved. You can now upgrade a source Command Central that uses the 
Entrust encryption to version 10.11. The required libraries for the Entrust encryption 
are now added to the migration framework in Command Central. 


CCE-8077
Software AG Command Central uses an outdated version of the 
third party component Apache XML Graphics, which has known security vulnerabilities. 

The issue is resolved. The Apache XML Graphics jar is migrated to the stable version 1.16. 


CCE-8064
Command Central uses an outdated version of the 
third party component Apache XmlGraphics Commons, which has known security vulnerabilities. 

The issue is resolved. The Apache XmlGraphics Commons jar is migrated to the stable 
version 2.8.0. 


CCE-7849
With Command Central, when bootstrapping a remote Platform Manager with missing 
SSH connectivity credentials, the validation job fails with a NullPointerException.

The issue is resolved. The correct message is now displayed in the validation log. 


CCE-7805
Running an installation with Command Central templates takes a long time in 
large environments.

The issue occurs in large environments because the handle of runtimes status 
for previous layers is done for every node from the previous layer.

The issue is resolved. The handle of runtimes status for previous layers is now 
done only for nodes that are part of the current layer.


CCE-7752
With Command Central, when bootstrapping a remote Platform Manager with invalid 
substitute user credentials, the job wrongly shows that the operation execution 
was a success instead of a failure.

The issue is resolved. The job now displays an error and states that the remote 
bootstrap operation failed.


CCE-7558
With Command Central, uninstalling fixes might fail when more than one 
version of the same fix has been installed. 

The issue occurs when the fixes that are being uninstalled are passed as artifact 
names containing only Fix ID and Platform Manager is restarted during the operation.

The issue is resolved. The fix deprovision job now runs successfully. 


CCE-7732
Running an installation with Command Central templates takes a long time in large environments.
The issue occurs in large environments because the handle of runtimes status for every layer 
and every node is executed sequentially.

The issue is resolved. Handling runtimes status is now executed in parallel for every node that 
is part of a layer.


CCE-7697
With Command Central, adding nodes to a new stack might fail with an error when the stack 
has no layer members.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-7562
MWS migration via Side-by-Side Stack Upgrade is failing with inappropriate message, if the db password 
is an empty string or encrypted string which actual value is an empty string.

The issue is resolved from CC side. When we provide an empty string or encrypted string which actual 
value is an empty string, then these parameters are not passed to the migration utility. 
The migration utility also requires changes which will be handled in some of the future fixes.


CCE-7621
When listing the dependencies of a fix in а repository from the Command Central Web User Interface, 
the fix dependencies for the fix fail to load with an exception.

The issue is resolved. Аfter you select the operating system, the Show Dependencies 
dialog loads the fix dependencies correctly.


CCE-7679
With Command Central Web User Interface, adding an Integration Server instance fails 
with an error while waiting to apply fixes.

The issue is resolved. The job now ends with a warning status in case Platform Manager 
is stopped and an appropriate warning message is given.


CCE-7659
With Command Central, creating an Installation Report in PDF format fails with an error when a 
managed installation contains a Broker instance.

The issue is resolved. The PDF Installation Report is successfully created and downloaded.


CCE-7652
With Software AG Command Central, creating an instance using a template might fail.
Creating an instance using a template fails without a descriptive message when the template does not 
have a fixes section.

The issue is resolved.

CCE-7486
With Software AG Command Central, installing assets fails with different error messages for each version 
when the varSubFile argument is not provided.

The issue is now resolved.


CCE-7548
With Software AG Command Central, you cannot update a mirror repository created to have 
LATEST to ALL fixes.

The issue is resolved. You can update a mirror repository with the artifacts=ALL parameter 
and it will contain all available fixes in the source repositories.


CCE-7511
With Software AG Command Central, importing a license key file that contains special characters 
may fail with an invalid license key error.

The issue is resolved. License key files with special characters can now be imported and validated.


CCE-7502
When using Software AG Command Central Side-by-Side migration to upgrade a stack from 
version 10.5 to version 10.11, the upgrade fails with an error.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-7342
Command Central fails with an error when a new remote installation is added from the Web 
user interface using SSH Private Key connectivity credentials.

When executing a remote Platform Manager bootstrap using SSH private key credentials, 
the execution fails with an error that the provided private key does not exist.

The issue is resolved. Platform Manager is now installed successfully on a remote machine 
when using SSH private key credentials.


SPM-5356
Installing fixes with Software AG Command Central might fail with an error.

When installing fixes over an HTTPS connection, Command Central fails to connect to 
Platform Manager. The issue occurs because of a defect in the JDK that Command Central uses.

The issue is resolved. The workaround described in the JDK-8160347 issue is now 
implemented in Command Central.


CCE-7148
Executing a cross-host migration in Command Central fails at the "Archive source node
directory" step when the source installation contains one or more directories with spaces in the
filepath. For example, the issue occurs when migrating an installation containing a Universal
Messaging instance.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central successfully executes cross-host migrations on
installations containing directories with spaces.


CCE-7144
When upgrading Command Central, if you provide a password value for the "-p" argument 
that is different from the administrator user password of the source Command Central, 
the upgrade operation fails with an error message that does not describe what has caused the failure. 
The issue occurs because you should provide the administrator user password 
of the source Command Central using the "-p" argument.

The issue is resolved. Now the error message states the cause of the failure correctly.


CCE-7143
In the Jobs view of the Command Central web user interface, in some cases Platform Manager 
provisioning jobs with status COMPLETED have their progress bar at 95%.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central shows a correct progress of 100% for completed Platform
Manager provisioning jobs.


CCE-7093
When you try to get a non-existing installation report by name in CC CLI, 
you get a 500 Internal Server Error instead of 404 Not Found.

whether the Platform Manager is source or target.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-7169

you cannot view the logs for the bootstrap job in the Jobs view in Command Central.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-7163
When refreshing the configuration cache, 
Command Central retrieves unnecessary data from the Platform Manager nodes.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-7164
When refreshing the configuration cache for several Platform Manager nodes in parallel, 
Command Central makes redundant requests to the Platform Manager nodes, which causes a data race.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-7233
Installing fixes using Command Central fails, because Command Central requires a password 
for the ADMINISTRATOR credential alias.
The issue is resolved. Command Central does not require a password 
for the ADMINISTRATOR credentials alias when installing fixes.


CCE-7018
When using stacks to do an overinstall migration, the migration might fail when the 
stack name and the alias of the Platform Manager node are long.

The issue is resolved.
