WCD-2086 (WCD_10.11_Fix6)

Previously, a common generic message without much information was being 
displayed to the user in case of an error while importing a provider project.

This issue is resolved. Now, the proper reason for the exception will be 
displayed as part of the message.

WCD-2069 (WCD_10.11_Fix5)

The Unpublish window in the Designer under the CloudStreams Development 
perspective would get stuck in a loop when attempting to unpublish a 
Provider package on the Current or Development server.

This issue was observed due to an exception occurring when clicking the 
'Next' button, as some fields such as Target Server and webMethods.io 
Integration tenants were null, causing the window to get stuck in the loop.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-2059 (WCD_10.11_Fix5)

Headers/mappings for multi-authentication enabled connectors were not 
updating correctly when the connection alias was changed from the pool.

This issue is now resolved.

WCD-2048 (WCD_10.11_Fix4)

While editing of cloud connector service, custom parameters from simple record type
fields are missing.

This issue is now resolved.

WCD-2011 (WCD_10.11_Fix4)

Users can create operations dynamically by pointing to a WSDL hosting web URL or
by uploading a Workday WSDL file locally. For complex operations, the "Next"
button should be enabled to select an abstract object on the "Operation and
Business Object Configuration" wizard.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-2046 (WCD_10.11_Fix3)

While creating a connector using a Swagger specification file, if the Swagger file 
contains an empty summary, then the connector fails to load into the Designer.

This issue is now resolved.

WCD-2010 (WCD_10.11_Fix2)

Few back-ends expect percent-encoding of reserved characters in the URI.

When a URI-based parameter value, containing a reserved character, has a special
meaning (a "reserved purpose") and the URI scheme has a different meaning or purpose
of the reserved character, then the reserved character must be percent-encoded. An
error occurs if an URI with a reserved character is not handled properly.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-2004 (WCD_10.11_Fix2)

If there are no webMethods.io Integration tenants configured and a user tries
to unpublish a connector from Development/Target Server(s), the "Next" button on the
"List of Target(s)" page does not work.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-1985 (WCD_10.11_Fix2)

The "Select All" button is enabled in the "Unpublish provider" screen even in scenarios
where there are no published connectors to select.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-1984 (WCD_10.11_Fix2)

While publishing connectors to webmethods.io Integration tenants, if the first connector
is not selected from the list of connectors of the same provider, the metadata for
connectors was incorrectly set.

This issue is resolved.

WF-16743 (WCD_10.11_Fix1)

Support for Publish and Unpublish of Connectors

Publish connectors to a webMethods.io Integration tenant

CloudStreams provides you the ability to publish connectors that reside within 
the on-premises application to the desired webMethods.io Integration tenant.

Unpublish published connectors from a webMethods.io Integration tenant

CloudStreams provides you the ability to unpublish the published connectors 
from the webMethods.io Integration tenant.

WCD-1921 (WCD_10.11_Fix1)

The table header in the Provider Refactor Preview screen gets blurred when
the screen is resized.

This issue is resolved.

8.0 Installation

Step 1: Install using the Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, 
see the documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: If you have migrated your connector services from a version prior to 
CloudStreams 9.7 and impacted by WST-2213, and you are yet to run the migration
utility as suggested in WST-2213, go to Step 2, else skip Step 2. If you have
created your connector services with a CloudStreams 9.7 or later version, you do
not need to run the migration utility.

Step 2: Run the CloudStreams migration utility (pub.cloudstreams.migration:migrate)
to migrate your old CloudStreams artifacts to the latest version.
For more information on the migration utility, see the Integration Server upgrade 
section in the "Upgrading Software AG Products" guide.



9.0 Uninstallation

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager. For instructions see the 
documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently 
installed fix. This action will revert your installation to the previously 
installed fix. You cannot apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.

product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data.


10.1 Localization

and these messages will appear in English.
