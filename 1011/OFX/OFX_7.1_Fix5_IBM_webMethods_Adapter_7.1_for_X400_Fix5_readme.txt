OFX-37
Updated copyright notes, vendor and product names for IBM rebranding.

OFX-27(OFX_7.1_Fix4)
In webmethods X.400 Adapter, the password provided for 
configuring the adapter is not masked and appears as a clear text.

This issue is resolved. The password entered is now masked.

OFX-29(OFX_7.1_Fix4)
In webMethods X.400 Adapter, the adapter's administrator UI
pages does not support the new Administrator screens of
Integration Server(IS) 10.1.

This issue is resolved. webMethods X.400 Adapter now supports the new
Administrator screens of IS from version 10.1 and later. 

OFX-25(OFX_7.1_Fix3)
webMethods X.400 Adapter 7.1 support for new Admin screens 
IS 9.10 onwards. 

webMethods X.400 Adapter 7.1 Admin UI pages did not support
new format of screens developed for IS 9.10. 

This issue is resolved now by modifying the webMethods X.400
Adapter 7.1 pages.

OFX-14(OFX_7.1_Fix2)
After installation of TNS_FIx13 wm.x400.tn.Util:getX400fields
gets java.lang.NullPointerException

This issue is now resolved.


OFX-12(OFX_7.1_Fix2)
When reloading the X400forTradingNetworks package of the 
webMethods X.400 Adapter, duplicate extended fields are 
created in the X.400 extended field group.

When you reload the X400forTradingNetworks package manually, 
or after restarting an Integration Server, duplicate 
extended fields are added to the X.400 extended field group 
for all partner profiles present in Trading Networks. This 
is an issue, because to make the extended field functions 
work, you should provide values for these duplicate fields.

This issue is now resolved. Reloading the 
X400forTradingNetworks package manually or after restarting 
Integration Server does not add any new fields in the X.400 
extended field group.

OFX-4(OFX_7.1_Fix1)
webMethods X.400 Adapter does not produce a submit notification
when sending back a notification.

When sending a positive, negative, or forwarded EDI notification
back to the sender of a document, X.400 Adapter does not produce
a submit notification. Instead, the adapter logs a
"cannot find documentId for uafiLocalId" exception in the
Integration Server log.

This issue is resolved. The documentID maps correctly to the
uafiLocalId in the crossReferenceList.xml file and X.400 Adapter
produces a submit notification.
