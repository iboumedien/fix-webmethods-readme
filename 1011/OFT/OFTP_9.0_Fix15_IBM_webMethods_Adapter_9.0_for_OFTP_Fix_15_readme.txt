is deleted but not the metadata file.

to provide a uniform approach in handling xml and non-xml files. 
The default value is false.    

OFT-42 (OFTP_9.0_Fix6)

In webMethods Adapter for OFTP, sending incorrect XML file, receiveOftp service 
goes in an infinite loop.

directory.

service wm.oftp.tn.Util:changeStatus.

In webMethods Adapter for OFTP, oftpPayload document omits the first 8KB of 
content in Inbound large files.

in receiveOftp service. 

This issue is resolved by writing the 8KB content of Inbound large file to 
oftpPayload document.

OFT-15 (OFTP_9.0_Fix2)
If Security Configurations are not defined for the wm.oftp.tn:deliverOftp 
service, Adapter 9.0 for OFTP does not use the default values defined in 
the Connection page of Integration Server Administrator. 

OFT-21 (OFTP_9.0_Fix2)

IS's reservation features. 

This issue is now resolved. 

OFT-17 (OFTP_9.0_Fix2)
Mapping related to the virtual file name was not supported. 

Input mappings for virtual filename, input format, input code, output code, max 
record size in the deliverOFTP service were provided.

output code,max record size in the deliverOFTP service. 

This issue is now resolved. 

OFT-18,OFT-19 (OFTP_9.0_Fix2)
Exceptions were thrown when processing outbound large files. 

While processing outbound files, whole file content used to be read in memory, 
hence If a file is very large then out of memory, Null pointer exceptions etc 
were getting thrown. 

This issue is resolved by making use of TN's large file handling and IS's 
reservation features.Hence heap space outage and other exceptions are avoided 
by using stream based approach.

webMethods OFTP Adapter support for new Admin screens IS 9.10 onwards. 

webMethods OFTP Adapter Admin UI pages did not support new format of screens
