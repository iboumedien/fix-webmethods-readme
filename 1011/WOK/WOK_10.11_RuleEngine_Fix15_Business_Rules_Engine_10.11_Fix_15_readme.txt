WOK-16517 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix1)
businessrulestargetruntime.isOnline=0 after initial start of WmBusinessRules package
When starting up the WmBusinessRules package for the first time on an Integration Server which 
connects to a MySQL database, the BUSINESSTARGETRUNTIMES.ISONLINE column wrongly contains the value 
0 instead of 1. This can cause Business Rules Hot Deployment to this Integration Server to fail.
This issue is now resolved.

WOK-17084 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix3)
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException during RMC auditing
When using the Rules Management Console on MWS and writing auditing information to the database, a 
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException occurs.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-17935 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix7)
Vulnerable 3rd Party Component commons-text used
Business Rules used a vulnerable version of commons-text: CVE-2022-42889.
This issue has been resolved by upgrading commons-text from from v1.8.0 to v1.10.0.

WOK-18196 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix10)
When using Business Rules to append many objects to a List, the existing appendToList function has 
adds a reference of that object to the List. This has limitations when trying to create a List with 
many distinct objects.
This has been resolved by introducing an appendCopyToList(Object[], Object objToCopy) function 
which will make a hard copy of an object before adding the copy to the List.

WOK-18200 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix10)
When adding a new rule using the "Add Rule" button, the new rule is empty. Since the RMC does not 
support working with Actions, n Action cannot be added to this new, empty row.
This has been resolved by adding a "Copy Rule" button which copies the selected rule along with all 
content, including actions.

WOK-18274 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix10)
When using the "appendToList" function in the Rules Management Console in My webMethods Server, a 
wrong "Function mismatched: ..." validation error was shown when attempting to append a complex 
object to a list of objects.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-18797 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix13)
Slow MWS UI performance with large decision tables
When working with large decision tables, the response times of the Business Rules UI on My 
webMethods Server can be very slow.
This issue has been improved by introducing cached validation, an improved decision entity list, 
improved validation logic and the introduction of a xml cache, resulting in faster UI response 
times.
If used in a cluster of My webMethods Server nodes, the newly introduced xml cache requires 
synchronization between the cluster nodes for proper operation. This required JMS communication can 
be achieved through Universal Messaging or the My webMethods Server database. Please refer to the 
"Administering My webMethods Server" documentation, chapters "Considerations When Building a My 
webMethods Server Cluster", "Configuring the Connection to the Universal Messaging Server" and 
"Configuring My webMethods Server to use the database for JMS communication" for details.

WOK-18955 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix12)
Insufficient Rules Runtime response times
In some specific cases, the response times of the Business Rules Runtime were perceived as too high.
This issue has been resolved by performance improvements in the Business Rules Runtime, which will 
decrease response times by 30%-40% in these cases.

WOK-19172 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix12)
xmlns: namespace in .decisiontable xml files changes
On Windows system, when building a rule project in Designer, the Asset Build Environment or the 
Rules Management Console, .decisiontable, .decisiontree, .eventrule and .externaleventrule xml 
files are created which may contain changed "xmlns:ns1" etc. attributes without user input. In 
version control use cases, these changes can lead to unwanted "changed file" situations.
This issue has been resolved by replacing the "xmlns:ns1" etc. namespaces with fixed "xmlns:dt" 
etc. namespaces when the file is edited and saved in Designer or the Rules Management Console.

WOK-19405 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix14)
Jess can get stuck during com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore.checkJessMLFiles()
In certain circumstances, the Rule Engine can become unresponsive while deploying a rule project.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-19521 (WOK_10.11_RuleEngine_Fix13)
Improved runtime deployment behavior
When re-deploying a rule project to the Business Rules Runtime, there is a small time period when 
the rule project is not available and invokes to the runtime fail.
This issue has been resolved by supporting "zero downtime" deployment of rule projects. If a 
previously existing rule project archive is deployed into the runtime, ongoing invocations to this 
rule project will continue to complete without errors. After the new rule project version is fully 
and successfully deployed, invocations to the rule project will use the newly deployed version, 
while the old version is removed from the runtime. In case of errors during deployment, the 
previously existing version of the rule project will remain deployed in the runtime.

WOK-20194
ServiceSetupException: [ISS.0026.9106] No method invokeFromProcess
When using the "Get Diagnostics" functionality in the Integration Server UI, in some cases the 
server.log file will contain entries like "Initialization of Java
Service wm.businessrules.runtime.consumer:invokeFromProcess failed due to error: 
com.wm.app.b2b.server.ServiceSetupException: [ISS.0026.9106] No method invokeFromProcess in class 
wm.businessrules.runtime.consumer"
This issue has been resolved by removing unneeded file artefacts for these removed services.
