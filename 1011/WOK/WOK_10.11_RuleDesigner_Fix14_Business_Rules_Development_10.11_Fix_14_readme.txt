WOK-16591 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix2)
Rule Set files are not updated during migration in JCR
When migrating a rule project which contains rule sets and external event rules, the rule set files 
were not migrates correctly, leading to validation errors in MWS.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-16669 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix2)
Business rules project deployment in cloud is not working in 10.11v Designer
When attempting to deploy a rule project to a Cloud Container 10.11 solution, a 
DeployToCloudException occurs.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-16955 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix5)
Designer plugins may load obsolete TPS libraries
When another Fix delivers a new version of a Java library, the Business Rules Designer plugins 
sometimes load the outdated and not the new version of this library.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-17045 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix5)
Plaintext password stored
When deploying Business Rules projects to Cloud Container, a plaintext password was stored in the 
Cloud Container configuration.
This issue is now resolved

WOK-17084 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix5)
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException during RMC auditing
When using the Rules Management Console on MWS and writing auditing information to the database, a 
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException occurs.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-18196 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix10)
When using Business Rules to append many objects to a List, the existing appendToList function has 
adds a reference of that object to the List. This has limitations when trying to create a List with 
many distinct objects.
This has been resolved by introducing an appendCopyToList(Object[], Object objToCopy) function 
which will make a hard copy of an object before adding the copy to the List.

WOK-18200 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix10)
When adding a new rule using the "Add Rule" button, the new rule is empty. Since the RMC does not 
support working with Actions, n Action cannot be added to this new, empty row.
This has been resolved by adding a "Copy Rule" button which copies the selected rule along with all 
content, including actions.

WOK-18274 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix10)
When using the "appendToList" function in the Rules Management Console in My webMethods Server, a 
wrong "Function mismatched: ..." validation error was shown when attempting to append a complex 
object to a list of objects.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-18797 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix13)
Slow MWS UI performance with large decision tables
When working with large decision tables, the response times of the Business Rules UI on My 
webMethods Server can be very slow.
This issue has been improved by introducing cached validation, an improved decision entity list, 
improved validation logic and the introduction of a xml cache, resulting in faster UI response 
times.
If used in a cluster of My webMethods Server nodes, the newly introduced xml cache requires 
synchronization between the cluster nodes for proper operation. This required JMS communication can 
be achieved through Universal Messaging or the My webMethods Server database. Please refer to the 
"Administering My webMethods Server" documentation, chapters "Considerations When Building a My 
webMethods Server Cluster", "Configuring the Connection to the Universal Messaging Server" and 
"Configuring My webMethods Server to use the database for JMS communication" for details.

WOK-18955 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix12)
Insufficient Rules Runtime response times
In some specific cases, the response times of the Business Rules Runtime were perceived as too high.
This issue has been resolved by performance improvements in the Business Rules Runtime, which will 
decrease response times by 30%-40% in these cases.

WOK-19172 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix12)
xmlns: namespace in .decisiontable xml files changes
On Windows system, when building a rule project in Designer, the Asset Build Environment or the 
Rules Management Console, .decisiontable, .decisiontree, .eventrule and .externaleventrule xml 
files are created which may contain changed "xmlns:ns1" etc. attributes without user input. In 
version control use cases, these changes can lead to unwanted "changed file" situations.
This issue has been resolved by replacing the "xmlns:ns1" etc. namespaces with fixed "xmlns:dt" 
etc. namespaces when the file is edited and saved in Designer or the Rules Management Console.

WOK-19405
Jess can get stuck during com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore.checkJessMLFiles()
In certain circumstances, the Rule Engine can become unresponsive while deploying a rule project.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-19521 (WOK_10.11_RuleDesigner_Fix13)
Improved runtime deployment behavior
When re-deploying a rule project to the Business Rules Runtime, there is a small time period when 
the rule project is not available and invokes to the runtime fail.
This issue has been resolved by supporting "zero downtime" deployment of rule projects. If a 
previously existing rule project archive is deployed into the runtime, ongoing invocations to this 
rule project will continue to complete without errors. After the new rule project version is fully 
and successfully deployed, invocations to the rule project will use the newly deployed version, 
while the old version is removed from the runtime. In case of errors during deployment, the 
previously existing version of the rule project will remain deployed in the runtime.
