7.0 Fix Contents

WED-10446
In Designer, caching of missing or non-exist nodes is missing.

 Large number of getNode and nodeExists service calls from a MAP when referenced document doesn't exist while loading the pipeline impacting the rendering of the pipeline UI.

The issue is resolved with the cache Null Nodes feature to prevent frequent service calls for non-existent nodes with-in the specified cache expiry time under Service Development -> Package Navigator -> Cache.

WED-10334 (ESB_10.11_Fix6)
Despite setting the Indentation tab policy to 'spaces only' in the Designer
preferences, the Java service editor allows tab characters in formatted code.

This fix includes changes to ensure that the Java service editor
exclusively uses spaces for indentation, eliminating all tab characters from the left indentation of formatted code when the Indentation tab policy
is 'spaces only' for a profile in Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style >
Formatter.

Additionally, this fix resolves the formatting issues encountered while enabling or disabling Indented elements > Empty lines for Indentation in Window > Preferences >Java > Code Style > Formatter.


WED-10346 (ESB_10.11_Fix6)
The Java service editor in Designer shows code indentation issues after
saving any changes.

Modifying Java service source code in the Java service editor and saving the
file or asset in Designer results in an unexpected left indentation of some
lines in the code, especially for the nested lines.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-10267 (ESB_10.11_Fix5)
Designer throws a compilation error while updating a Java service that uses
an old service signature.

In Designer, under Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter,
if "Indentation size" is set to 2 in the active custom profile, a compilation
error occurs while updating a Java service that uses an old service signature 
because Designer duplicates the code for the primary Java service method.
 
This issue is now resolved. 


WED-10023/WED-10074/WED-10216/WED-10177/WED-10157/WED-10292 (ESB_10.11_Fix5)
At times, Designer 10.11 does not display pipeline contents instantly.

During flow service development or debugging, Designer displays the pipeline
contents for an element with a slight delay of one second or less. Typically,
the delay occurs when the pipeline has multiple document references and
transformers in the mappings.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-10059 (ESB_10.11_Fix4)
Designer for macOS does not resize the Result view correctly.

When you run a service in Designer, Designer displays
compressed Name and Value columns for the Pipeline tab in the
Results view. Hence, you must manually resize the Result view to
see the results.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9982 (ESB_10.11_Fix4)
In Designer, lines of code disappear while editing a flow service.

In Designer, consider a flow service with multiple steps such as MAP,
INVOKE, and so on under steps such as SEQUENCE and REPEAT. While
editing the flow service using operations such as Move Left and
Move Right, Designer throws an exception that results in missing code.

This issue is now resolved.


WED-9899 (ESB_10.11_Fix3)
During Cloud deployment, Designer throws the "Unhandled event
loop exception" error while selecting assets with recursive dependency.

The issue is resolved.


WED-9852 (ESB_10.11_Fix2)
In Designer, debugging a Java service with a test harness throws
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException.

In Designer, debugging a Java service using the generated test harness
results in the java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.xml.soap.Node
exception. The exception is due to a missing library in the
auto-generated service development project.

This issue is now resolved.

Note:
As part of the post-installation steps, use a new workspace for Designer
or remove the existing auto-generated projects from the disk before
generating the code for debugging a Java service. 


WED-9719 (ESB_10.11_Fix1)
In Designer, creating an OData service is slow.

Creating an OData service from external entities is slow after selecting 
the JDBC connection alias as Designer takes time to render the tables 
fetched from the JDBC connection.

This issue is resolved by selecting "Use grouping in tree browser" in 
Window > Preferences > Software AG > Service Development > 
Adapter Service / Notification Editor.


WED-9639 (ESB_10.11_Fix1)
Creating a provider REST API Descriptor from a Swagger document fails with 
"NullPointerException".

This issue is now resolved.


WEL-139 (ESB_10.11_Fix1)
The Java service editor fails to recognize the external library references in
packages.

Designer excludes the external libraries in the project classpath.
Hence, the Java service editor fails to recognize the external library
references in the packages opened locally for service development.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9412 (ESB_10.11_Fix1)
Switching between the Pipeline and Data Mapper views applies smart
mapping recommendations to a flow service without the user's acceptance.

While using smart mapping recommendations for a flow service, switching between
the Pipeline and Data Mapper views applies the recommendations even though the
user does not click "Accept selected" or "Accept All".

This issue is now resolved.
