7.0 Fix Contents

This fix addresses the following issues:

SYN-77
In the IBM webMethods Module 6.5.2 for 1SYNC, the copyright information is updated.

This issue is now resolved.

SYN-70 (ONESYNC_6.5.2_Fix9)
Sending messages to 1SYNC fails because the validation of the 
envelope against the schema fails. This issue occurs because the 
schema is of version 2.0 while the services refer to version 1.0. 
  
This issue is resolved. The services are updated to version 
2.0 and the URL to schema locations are updated with the latest 
versions.

SYN-65 (ONESYNC_6.5.2_Fix8)
IBM webMethods Module 6.5.2 for 1SYNC supports version 1.0 TN. In the 
IBM webMethods Module 6.5.2 for 1SYNC, the copyright information is updated.

This issue is now resolved.
Document types and schemas. Whereas, version 2.0 TN Document
types and schemas are required.
                                   
This issue is now resolved. After applying IBM webMethods 1SYNC
Module 6.5.2 Fix 8, the module provides support for version
2.0 TN Document types and schemas instead of version 1.0 TN
Document types and schemas. 

SYN-60 (ONESYNC_6.5.2_Fix7)
IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module contains references to the WmUCCnet package
which is deprecated.

The wm.ip.sync.common.profile:getTPAInfo service contains
references to the document type, wm.ip.uccnet.cm.recs:TPAInfo in
the deprecated WmUCCnet package.

This issue is resolved. All the references to the deprecated
WmUCCnet package is now removed.

SYN-57 (ONESYNC_6.5.2_Fix6)
Update IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 to include the 1SYNC IM
Release 6.8 schema changes.

This issue is resolved. IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 now includes
the 1SYNC IM Release 6.8 schema changes. 


SYN-49 (ONESYNC_6.5.2_Fix4)
Update IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 to include the 1SYNC IM
Release 6.6 schema changes.

This issue is resolved. IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 now includes
the 1SYNC IM Release 6.6 schema changes. 


SYN-38 (ONESYNC_6.5.2_Fix3)
Update IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 with the revised XML schema
released by 1SYNC on 10/22/2008.

Currently, IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 does not include the 
IM 6.4 XML schema released by 1SYNC.

This issue is now resolved.

SYN-36 (ONESYNC_6.5.2_Fix3)
IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 on Integration Server 7.1.2 throws 
an exception while sending documents to 1SYNC.

1SYNC Module 6.5.2 on Integration Server 7.1.2 throws the 
following exception while sending documents to 1SYNC:

  com.wm.lang.flow.FlowException: Error trapped in service
  : wm.ip.sync.transport:send Error: [ISC.0049.9010] Service
  'wm.tn.route:routeBizdoc' invoking unknown service 
  'pub.prt.tn:handleBizDoc' at '$default'. The service may 
  have been renamed, moved or disabled.
  
This error message occurs when the process runtime is not 
configured in the IBM webMethods Integration Server. When the 
IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 sends a document to 1SYNC, it 
extracts the conversation ID of the document, and then Trading 
Networks invokes the process runtime to execute a process model 
associated with the document type. If the process runtime is not 
installed when 1SYNC Module is sending the document, an exception 
occurs.

This issue is resolved either by installing the WmPRT package or 
by setting the value of the 1Sync.ignorePRTDocument parameter to 
'true'. When the process runtime is not installed in Integration 
Server, to prevent the exception, set the value of the new 
1Sync.ignorePRTDocument configuration parameter to 'true' in the 
<Integration_Server>\packages\Wm1SYNC\config\config.cnf file.

1-1RKLXT (OneSYNC_6-5-2_Fix1)
Reference to wm.ip.util:formatErrorMessage service not completely
removed from IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2.

If IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 has to run on IBM webMethods
Integration Server 7.1, all the dependencies on WmIPRoot package
should be removed from the module. But,
wm.ip.sync.common.profile:getTPAInfo and
wm.ip.sync.common.profile:getProfile services are still dependent
on wm.ip.util:formatErrorMessage service. Due to these
dependencies, IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 cannot run on
IBM webMethods Integration Server 7.1.

This issue is resolved. IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 is now
compatible with IBM webMethods Integration Server 7.1.
wm.ip.sync.common.profile:getTPAInfo and
wm.ip.sync.common.profile:getProfile services now call
wm.ip.logutil:formatErrorMessage service instead of calling
wm.ip.util:formatErrorMessage service.

1-1S0JFR
Update IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 with the revised XML Schema
released by 1SYNC on 12/14/2007.

IBM webMethods 1SYNC Module 6.5.2 has not yet included the latest XML
Schema released by 1SYNC.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1S0JH2
In wm.ip.sync.recs:docType_ns_catalogueItemNotification and
wm.ip.sync.recs:docType_ns_catalogueRequest Integration Server
documents, the attrGroup and attrGroupMany element names are
prefixed with "ns:" namespace (ns:attrGroup and
ns:attrGroupMany).

When the Integration Server creates a document from an XML schema
and if there is a reference to any Integration Server document in
that schema, then the attrGroup and attrGroupMany elements are
prefixed with "ns:" namespace. This behavior is normal, however
some users may not want the element names to be prefixed with
"ns:" namespace.

This issue is now resolved. The attrGroup and attrGroupMany
element names are no longer prefixed with "ns:" namespace.
