6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Back up the My webMethods Server database and file system before installing this fix.								     

2. Before starting a fix installation shut down all My webMethods Server cluster nodes. 
   Software AG Update Manager will shut down and restart My webMethods Server during fix 
   installation. Software AG Update Manager waits for a preconfigured time of 300000 ms (5 mins) 
   for My webMethods Server to shut down and restart. If a particular My webMethods Server 
   instance takes more time for shutdown and restart, you can configure the wait time by setting
   the following system property for Software AG Update Manager:
   -Dmws.shutdown.waittime = <time_in_ms>
   
3. If multiple nodes exist in one SAG installation directory, the Software AG Update Manager will 
   install the fix on all the nodes.																		  								  
   
4. If the cluster nodes are on different installation/machines, the fix installation should be done 
   sequentially for each My webMethods Server cluster node. Wait for Software AG Update Manager to 
   complete the fix installation on one My webMethods Server installation before installing the fix to 
   another cluster node installation/machine.

5. If you have a webMethods product that runs outside of the current webMethods installation 
   directory (the directory in which you installed this fix) and uses any of the files in
   <webMethods_directory>/common/lib, then apply this fix to the other product installation
   
6. Applying a fix reverts the MWS\server\default\bin\server.properties.[bat|sh],
   MWS\bin\setenv.[bat|sh], MWS\bin\mws.[bat|sh], MWS\server\default\config\wrapper.conf files to
   their default contents.
   If you made changes to these files, create a backup of these files before installing the fix, 
   and change the required values again after the fix installation completes.
   
7. This fix requires manual modifications to the jetty.xml configuration file for My webMethods Server.
   After installing this fix, retrieve the jetty.xml file from the server database and substitute 
   the <Ref id="Contexts" attributes with <Ref refid="Contexts".



7.0 Fix Contents

The instance management commands for My webMethods Server do not provide an option for installing
the latest available fixes when creating or recreating a new server instance, or the OSGi profile
for a server instance.

The issue is resolved. The instance management scripts are enhanced to support the creation of
instances, patched to the latest fix level available in the configured fix repository. Now the
CLI utility for My webMethods Server will invoke Software AG Update Manager and install the latest
available fixes each time you issue one of the following commands:

mws new - to create a new server instance; mws create-osgi-profile - to create an OSGi profile for
a server instance. By default The CLI utility for My webMethods Serve looks for Software AG
Update Manager in the same installation directory as your My webMethods Server installation. You
can specify a different Update Manager location, and further customize the Update Manager
behavior by adding a sum.properties file in <Software AG_installation_directory>/MWS/bin. The
sum.properties file can contain the following parameters:

sum.install.dir=<dir> - Full path to the Update Manager installation directory. Optional. If empty
or not specified, the default is <Software AG_installation_directory>/SAGUpdateManager.
sum.image.location=<path> - Full path to an existing fix image. Optional. sum.empower.user=<user>
- The Update Manager user. Optional. sum.empower.pass=pass_or_pass_file> - The Update Manager
password. Optional. Valid values are: plain text, encypted password, or a password file. Specify
the password file as a fully qualified URI as in
sum.empower.pass=file:/C:/my_files/my_pass_file/sum_pass.txt. Encrypt the pasword using the
procedure, documented in Administering My webMethods Server. In addition, the CLI utility for My
webMethods Server will attempt to call Software AG Update Manager and refresh the metadata it
stores for a server instance each time you issue the delete or delete-osgi-profile commands.

When running in a container, My webMethods Server does not store the log files, generated by the
My webMethods Server command line utility such as the update-node-name_<nodeName>.log file in the
designated external logs volume.

The issue is resolved. My webMethods Server now stores all log files, including command line
utility logs in the external volume when such volume is specified at container startup.




MWS-29534 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When attempting to create a user with a user ID that has more than the allowed number of
characters, My webMethods Server displays an incorrect error message that the allowed number of

of characters in the user ID, which is 226.




MWS-29600 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When using the My webMethods Server command-line utility to issue commands that require opening a
database connection such as getconfig, My webMethods Server does not close the database
connections and might cause multiple  warnings in the database server logs.

The issue is resolved.




MWS-29611 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
Bundle resolution might fail when deploying war files to My webMethods Server. This issue occurs
with war files that use optional imports, as declared by the default (generated) bundle manifest.

The issue is resolved. To ensure proper bundle resolution, My webMethods Server and Asset Build
Environment are enhanced to provide the option to control how bundles are resolved by the
quinox  platform using BND templates which are applied to multiple components. This option works
in addition  to the current implementation, which generates bundle manifests using a default
template with optional  resolution. Instructions from custom BND files for a particular
application (OSGI-OPT/bnd.bnd)  continue to get merged with the template. Now you can also add
one or more custom BND files to  control the template contents, and apply custom instructions to
multiple applications. Custom  instructions are applied when building assets with Asset Build
Environment or when deploying bundles  to My webMethods Server. For more information about
working with BND templates,  see Administering My webMethods Server.




MWS-29621 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)

MWS-29636 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
Logging in to My webMethods Server using single sign-on might fail with a 'Error in validating
SAML Response:Incoming SAML message is invalid' error message. This issue occurs when: 1. The user
does not complete the SAML authentication process in more than several minutes. 2. The
authentication request is initialized via HTTP, and the response uses HTTPS.

The issue is resolved. Now you can explicitly disable the validation of the InResponseToField in
the SAML response by adding the mws.saml.sin.disable.request.caching property in the
custom_wrapper.conf file for My webMethods Server, with a value of true, as follows:
wrapper.java.additional.nnn=-Dmws.saml.sin.disable.request.caching=true, where nnn is the unique
sequential number of the property.




MWS-29710 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
Task Engine might fail to sort task instances when using a DB2 database.

When you attempt to sort task instances on the Task List Management page in My webMethods by
assignee (the Assigned To column), Task Engine might display the following error message:
[SoftwareAG][DB2 JDBC Driver][DB2]The character value for the CAST, DECIMAL, FLOAT, or INTEGER
scalar function is invalid. This issue occurs when using a DB2 database.

The issue is resolved.

My webMethods Server might terminate a user session due to timeout although the user is still
actively interacting with the system.

The issue is resolved.




MWS-29879 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When updating a newly installed instance, My webMethods Server might include the admin-pass.jar to
the OSGi profile for the instance.

The issue is resolved. Updating the server instance no longer adds the admin-pass.jar to the
instance profile.




MWS-29976 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
The generated marker file for validating the data and logs volumes for My webMethods Server
container does not include the value of the required nodeName attribute.

MWS-29977 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
The generated marker file for validating the data and logs volumes for My webMethods Server
container does not include the value of the required cluster ID attribute.

The issue is resolved.




MWS-29995 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
My webMethods Server containers might shut down unexpectedly shortly after initialization. This
issue occurs when the container connects to a database which has already been initialized by an
on-premises My webMethods Server installation.

The issue is resolved. The startup validation for My webMethods Server containers is enhanced to
detect if the database is initialized by an on-premises installation and fail before starting the
runtime.




MWS-30104 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
My webMethods Server might display an 'Authentication statement is too old to be used with value'
error message when a My webMethods user attempts to log in again after the user session expires
due to a period of inactivity. This issue occurs with SAML SSO, when the period of validity of
the SAML assertion of the IDP is longer than the default period for My webMethods Server.

The issue is resolved. My webMethods Server now supports the maxAuthenticationAge property for
SAML SSO to allow setting the same validity period as in the IDP configuration. To modify the
assertion validity time, add the mws.saml.sin.max.authentication.age property to the
custom_wrapper.conf file for My webMethods Server as follows:
wrapper.java.additional.nnn=-Dmws.saml.sin.max.authentication.age=<value_in_seconds>, where nnn
is the unique sequential number of the property. The default validity period is 7200 seconds.




MWS-30105 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
The JSR-349 Bean Validation in Composite Application Framework applications might stop working.

The issue is resolved.




MWS-30106 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
The spFolderByOwner database procedure that My webMethods Server executes when loading user
folders might work inefficiently with large amounts of data.

The issue is resolved. The performance of the query that loads user folders is improved by adding
an additional database index. This speeds up operation when the database contains large amounts
of data.




MWS-30116 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When running in a Docker container, My webMethods Server does not create the default instance log
directory in the designated default volume (MWS/volumes/logs/instance_logs).

The issue is resolved.




MWS-30202 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When using webMethods Deployer to deploy web applications to My webMethods Server, the server
might process resource cache incorrectly and cause issues in the operation of the deployed
applications.

The issue is resolved.




MWS-30206 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
Task Engine might log error messages during task reindexing. This issue occurs when reindexing a
task type that is not associated with any task instances.

The issue is resolved.




MWS-30223 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
My webMethods might fail to open some of the pages that you add to the left hand side menu for My
webMethods in new tabs, or act inconsistently when navigating between menus. This issue occurs
when the userAlias attribute of the <wm_xt_fabricfolder> definition contains non-ASCII characters.

The issue is resolved.




MWS-30382 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When running on My webMethods Server, Task Engine might log an "java.sql.SQLException: Failed to
start database './TASKLWQ'... Caused by: org.apache.derby.iapi.error.StandardException: Another
instance of Derby may have already booted the database
/home/administrator/softwareag/common/bin/TASKLWQ" error message. This issue occurs when two or
more of the My webMethods Server instances are installed on the same host.

The issue is resolved. For the fix to take effect on existing installations, you must add the
following additional JVM property in the custom_wrapper.conf file for My webMethods Server:
wrapper.java.additional.nnn=-Dderby.system.home="%SERVER_HOME%/system/lwq"
wrapper.java.additional.nnn.stripquotes=TRUE,  where nnn is the unique sequential number of the
property. For more information about working with the custom_wrapper.conf file, see Administering
My webMethods Server.




WTN-5523 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
The searchTaskIndexed built-in service in Task Engine might return unexpected results. This issue
occurs when upgrading to Task Engine versions later than 9.7, if the parameter
DoNotShowAcceptedByOthers is set to true in a non-inbox search.

The issue is resolved. In older Task Engine versions, the DoNotShowAcceptedByOthers is ignored
when performing non-inbox searches (with searchUserTasks set to false). For backward
compatibility, now Task Engine provides the task.donotshowacceptedbyothers.disable custom JVM
property. When set to true, Task Engine search services ignore the value of the
DoNotShowAcceptedByOthers parameter.




WTN-5537 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When using task types with task assignment events, Task Engine might fail to assign tasks and log
a java.lang.IllegalStateException error message. This issue occurs when the task includes multiple
events.

The issue is resolved.




WTN-5539 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
Task Engine might log multiple 'Task is out of date' warnings. This issue occurs when multiple
threads from a custom application access the getTask API and the cached copy of the task that the
API returns is not up to date.

The issue is resolved. Now Task Engine is enhanced to query the database for the latest copy of
the task before returning it through the API. For the fix to take effect, you must add the
task.enable.strong.consistency custom JVM property in the custom_wrapper.conf file for the My
webMethods Server instance that hosts Task Engine, and set the property value to true, as
follows: wrapper.java.additional.nnn=-Dtask.enable.strong.consistency=true, where nnn is the
unique sequential number of the property. Note that using the strong consistency setting might
have performance impact on systems under heavy load.




WTN-5562 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
When using the built-in search services with the "is empty" and "is not empty" operators, Task
Engine returns incorrect results.

The issue is resolved.




WTN-5578 (MWS_10.11_Fix1)
Task Engine might ignore the cache policies configurations, set in the cache.xml file for the
hosting My webMethods Server instance.

The issue is resolved.
