6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Back up the My webMethods Server database and file system before installing this fix.								     

2. Before starting a fix installation shut down all My webMethods Server cluster nodes. 
   Software AG Update Manager will shut down and restart My webMethods Server during fix 
   installation. Software AG Update Manager waits for a preconfigured time of 300000 ms (5 mins) 
   for My webMethods Server to shut down and restart. If a particular My webMethods Server 
   instance takes more time for shutdown and restart, you can configure the wait time by setting
   the following system property for Software AG Update Manager:
   -Dmws.shutdown.waittime = <time_in_ms>
   
3. If multiple nodes exist in one SAG installation directory, the Software AG Update Manager will 
   install the fix on all the nodes.																		  								  
   
4. If the cluster nodes are on different installation/machines, the fix installation should be done 
   sequentially for each My webMethods Server cluster node. Wait for Software AG Update Manager to 
   complete the fix installation on one My webMethods Server installation before installing the fix to 
   another cluster node installation/machine.

5. If you have a webMethods product that runs outside of the current webMethods installation 
   directory (the directory in which you installed this fix) and uses any of the files in
   <webMethods_directory>/common/lib, then apply this fix to the other product installation
   
6. Applying a fix reverts the MWS\server\default\bin\server.properties.[bat|sh],
   MWS\bin\setenv.[bat|sh], MWS\bin\mws.[bat|sh], MWS\server\default\config\wrapper.conf files to
   their default contents.
   If you made changes to these files, create a backup of these files before installing the fix, 
   and change the required values again after the fix installation completes.



7.0 Fix Contents

The fix will change the structure of the database. Review the fix contents 
carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes 
for the release.

MWS-31270 (MWS_10.11_Database_Fix2)
Upgrading My webMethods Server from version 10.3 to version 10.11 might fail. This issue occurs
when using a cloned DB2 database.

The issue is resolved.


WTN-5861 (MWS_10.11_Database_Fix2)
Some of the scripts that create Task Engine indexes are not included in the database scripts for
MySQL.

The issue is resolved.

MWS-30078 (MWS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
When migrating the My webMethods Server database from version 10.7 or earlier, the Database
Component Configurator registers two additional components. For Oracle and DB2 databases, the
records added to the COMPONENT_EVENT table do not fill the tablespace-related columns, and might
return null when executing a Catalog operation.

The issue is resolved. The tablespace-related columns are now populated properly during migration.


MWS-30107 (MWS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
Attempting to re-execute the migration of the database component for My webMethods Server fails
with a "java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: [SoftwareAG][SQLServer JDBC Driver][SQLServer]Column
names in each table must be unique. Column name 'SOURCE' in table 'TBLPORTALVERSION' is specified
more than once." error message. This issue occurs when upgrading from My webMethods Server
version 10.5 to version 10.7 with fix 1.

The issue is resolved.


MWS-30803 (MWS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
My webMethods Server might fail to start up after upgrade.

The issue is resolved.


MWS-30844 (MWS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
The Database Component Configurator might set an incorrect database level during My webMethods
Server upgrade.

When migrating the database component for My webMethods Server from a version older than 10.7, the
database scripts for My webMethods Server register two new database components with level 10.7,
regardless of the version you are upgrading to, and cause errors during subsequent runs.

The issue is resolved.
