DTS-2999
In Integration Server Administrator > Logs > Server, the tooltip entries extend
beyond the tooltip box for long and continuous text.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2814 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix13)
Integration Server Administrator uses the browser's local storage to store 
preferences for individual users and leverages usernames to access an individual's 
preferences. This poses a security risk.

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server Administrator no longer stores 
preferences for multiple users within individual browsers, and usernames are no 
longer stored in the browser's local storage.

DTS-2839 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix13)
Corrections to server log display in Integration Server Administrator.

The following issues in the Server > Logs > Server page in Integration Server 
Administrator have been fixed:

- The First line to display list accepts zero (0) as the value and uses 0 as the 
default. The default (and minimum value) is now 1.
- Entering a value larger than 65535 in the field Number of entries to display,
results in Integration Server writing the following error to the server log, 
possibly multiple times: [ISS.0035.0004E] (tid=<threadID>) Returned 65,535 lines 
while requested for 500,000 number of lines for error logs. Now, values greater 
than 65,535 are not accepted.
- After a refresh interval is set, the logs are not aligned.
- When the dual vertical scroll bars appear, the tooltip text for lengthy logs 
may stretch beyond the tooltip borders.

DTS-2889 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix13)
Non-administrator users cannot log into API Gateway after 
watt.server.defaultPackage is set to WmRoot.

After the watt.server.defaultPackage server configuration parameter is set to 
WmRoot and Integration Server is restarted, a user that does not have 
Administrator access to API Gateway can no longer log in.

This issue is now resolved.

Note: Only members of the Administrators ACL can log into Integration Server 
Administrator. This restriction does not apply to API Gateway.

DTS-2900 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix13)
By default, Integration Server Administrator displays Server log entries in
ascending order starting with the earliest log entry.

Log entries in the Logs > Server page are sorted by line number, beginning with
the lowest number representing the earliest log entry. This causes the most
recent log entries to appear at the end.

The Logs > Server page now displays server log entries in descending order,
beginning with the most recent entry. Click the Server Log Entry column name to
change the sorting.

DTS-2682 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix12)
In Integration Server Administrator > Logs > Server, the tooltips for some long
entries have a display issue where the text extends beyond the background of the 
tooltip box. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2599 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix12)
The Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator shows Cluster status is Off
even when the status is On, if Statistics Data Collection is disabled in
Dashboard configuration.

This issue is now resolved. The Cluster Status is displayed as Unknown and a
message that the statistics data collection is disabled appears if the
Statistics Data Collection is disabled.

PIE-82499 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix11)
The Integration Server Administrator APIs for the alert resource should use the
POST method instead of PUT for administrative actions. 

The following operations for the alert resource are now deprecated and will not
appear in the OpenAPI (Swagger) document for the Administrator API. 

PUT /admin/alert
PUT /admin/alert/id/{id}
PUT /admin/alert/notifier/{name}

The operations listed above are now supported as:

POST /admin/alert
POST /admin/alert/id/{id}
POST /admin/alert/notifier/{name}

PIE-83320 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix11)
Integration Server fails to accept a number with a unit of measurement 
(KB, MB, or GB) for the watt.server.http.interceptor.preprocess.sizeLimit 
server configuration parameter using the new Integration Server Administrator.

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-84441 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix11)
The /metrics endpoint returns multiple instances of the metrics
sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis and sag_is_service_requests_total with
different timestamps. 

Now, the /metrics endpoint returns only a single instance of the
sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis and sag_is_service_requests_total
metrics for each IS service. 

Additionally, JVM and server metrics are now based on current data at the time
the /metrics endpoint is called.  In the past, JVM and server metrics were based
on aggregated data that could be several minutes old. 

PIE-84960 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix11)
The sag_is_server_total_memory_mbytes and sag_is_server_used_memory_mbytes
metrics incorrectly reported values for the Integration Server JVM heap memory
instead of the operating system memory. 

Now, these metrics measure operating system memory.

DTS-2515 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
In Integration Server Administrator > Logs > Server, the incomplete horizontal
scroll prevents the user from fully viewing the server logs.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2516 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
In Monitoring, the Edit pipeline dialog for a service shows empty service
inputs.

In Integration Server Administrator > Monitoring, the Edit pipeline dialog for
a service does not display service inputs if the field names or a document name
in the fields' hierarchy has one or more dots.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2532 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
The Dashboard and server logs show erroneous error messages when the Statistics
Data Collector is disabled. 

The Statistics Data Collector gathers metrics displayed in the Dashboard in
Integration Server Administrator. When the Statistics Data Collector is
intentionally disabled, Integration Server Administrator and the server log
display error messages indicating it is disabled. For example, the server log
contains: 

[ISS.0030.0013E] (tid=###) An exception was encountered while processing an
administrative request. See the error log for details: [ISS.0030.0385] Search
request failed. Details: DISABLED 

Integration Server Administrator displays: [ISS.0030.0385] Search request
failed. Details: DISABLED 

These errors should not be logged or displayed when the Statistics Data
Collector is intentionally disabled. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2585 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
The Statistics Data Collector incorrectly excludes some metrics data in the REST
resources used in Integration Service Administrator dashboard.

This issue is now resolved.

The Exclude system services check box is now removed from the Integration Server
Administrators' Dashboard APIs page, resulting in displaying all the data
returned by the REST service call.

PIE-81502 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
The keystore and truststore resources cannot be reloaded using the 
administrator APIs as they do not have the reload action. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81692 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
The Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator displays an invalid value for
the Uptime field on the Overview tab. 
 
Now, the Uptime field displays the correct value. The Uptime field displays the
amount of time since Integration Server started. 

PIE-83641 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
During Integration Server startup, the Statistics Data Collector skips
collection of some OS and Integration Server data. 

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-84373 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
Overview tab in Integration Server Administrator Dashboard does not display any
data but does display a NumberFormatException alert. 

This issue is resolved.

PIE-84389 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
Statistics Data Collector incorrectly excludes some statistics for REST APIs.

When the Exclude system services check box is selected on the APIs page of the
Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator, the REST API metrics incorrectly
excludes data from automatically generated services. The Exclude system services
check box was intended to exclude metrics data produced by a service in Wm*
system package. However, the Statistics Data Collector treats services generated
automatically when creating assets in Designer as system services. 

To address this issue, the Statistics Data Collector no longer excludes services
from its metrics gathering for REST APIs. 

Note: This is the server side change for DTS-2588 which removes the Exclude
system services check box. 

PIE-84568 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix10)
Updates to internal resources in the Integration Server Administrator API to
support the Dashboard. 

DTS-2371 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix9)
Occasionally, Integration Server Administrator displays "[ISS.0030.0030] You
must log in to access the Administrator API."

Integration Server Administrator displays the error momentarily and lets the
user login.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2389 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix9)
The pipeline editor in the Monitoring view of Integration Server Administrator
does not show fields that are not declared in the service signature. 

When using the Edit pipeline feature in the Monitoring view of Integration
Server Administrator, fields that are not declared in the service signature do
not appear. Specifically, if a service input signature contains a Document
variable with undefined content (an open document), the Edit pipeline feature
does not display any fields that exist in the Document at run time. 

Now, the pipeline editor in the Monitoring view displays the runtime contents of
the Document. 

DTS-2427 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix9)
In Integration Server Administrator > Logs > Server, empty spaces appear at the
end of the Server log, when "Number of entries to display" exceeds the
number of entries in the Integration Server log.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2434 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix9)
In Integration Server Administrator, the "Yes" and "No" buttons in the "Confirm
dismissal of all notifications" dialog are misaligned.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2448 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix9)
In the Services page of Monitoring, you cannot simultaneously select all
services that can be resubmitted. 

The issue is resolved. You can now use the checkbox in the header of the search
results table to select all services that can be resubmitted. 

PIE-82415 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix9)
Updated moment.js library in Integration Server Administrator.

Integration Server Administrator uses the moment.js library to handle dates and
times. However, the moment.js library version 2.26.0 included in Integration
Server Administrator has known security vulnerabilities.

Now, Integration Server Administrator includes moment.js version 2.29.4 to
address the security vulnerabilities.

DTS-2321 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix8)
When Integration Server Administrator is idle for a period of time, the session
timeout notification appears. Clicking the "Stay logged in" in the session
timeout notification fails to keep the user logged in.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2005 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix7)
Integration Server Administrator is vulnerable to HTML injection as the HTML
escapes are not applied to the HTML content in Integration Server Error logs.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2237 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix7)
When auditing a failed service with Integration Server Administrator >
Monitoring, you cannot save the service pipeline and use it for
troubleshooting.

This issue is resolved. In Integration Server Administrator > Monitoring >
Services, the Service details page now has the "Save pipeline to file" button
that you use to save the service pipeline to a file.

DTS-2274 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix7)
In the Services page of Monitoring, you cannot copy an entire value from a
truncated field in the services table. 

The issue is resolved. You can now select a truncated field and copy the entire
value. 

DTS-2152 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix6)
After upgrading Integration Server from a lower version to 10.15, Integration
Server Administrator may not display columns in the Service instances table.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2153 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix6)
Integration Server Administrator slows down when Integration Server receives
numerous notifications.

This issue is resolved. Integration Server now receives a maximum of 500
notifications.

DTS-2184 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix6)
When Integration Server runs with the Turkish locale, accessing the new
Integration Server Administrator sometimes results in the error "License key is
expired or invalid". 

The issue is now fixed.

PIE-74710 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix6)
A GET request for an /alert resources in the Integration Server Administrator 
API results in an error message when valid values are supplied for startTime and 
endTime in a URL parameter.

This issue is now fixed. 

DTS-2076 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix5)
While viewing individual error messages on the Administration > Logs > Error 
page, the stack trace columns allow users only a truncated view of lengthy 
error messages.

This issue is now resolved. A horizontal scrollbar is added to stack trace 
table columns to enable users to scroll through lengthy error messages.

DTS-2081 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix5)
Occasionally, Integration Server Administrator takes longer than expected (up to 
one minute) to display error logs on the Administration > Logs > Error page. 

This issue is now resolved. 

DTS-2126 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix5)
When using Integration Server Administrator on AIX, the login page redirects and
forces the user to change the password even after a successful password change.

This issue is now resolved. After applying this fix and then successfully
changing the password, the user can access Integration Server Administrator.

DTS-2127
In Monitoring, the Edit pipeline dialog for a service shows empty service
inputs.

In Integration Server Administrator > Monitoring, the Edit pipeline dialog for
a service does not display service inputs if the field names or a document name
in the fields' hierarchy has one or more dots.

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-78271 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix5)
Integration Server Administrator throws a java.time.zone.ZoneRulesException.

If the timezone used by Integration Server is set to an invalid value, accessing
the new Integration Server Administrator results in a
java.time.zone.ZoneRulesException. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server captures the
java.time.zone.ZoneRulesException and uses the timezone set in in the Java
system property user.timezone instead. 

DTS-1539 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix4)
Some minor but essential accessibility best practices are not followed in 
Integration Server Administrator, such as the use of alternative (alt) for 
icons, aria-labels, table headers, labels for all UI elements in dialog boxes, 
and so on.

This issue is now resolved. All identified accessibility gaps in 
Integration Server Administrator have been fixed. 

DTS-1684 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix4)
On navigating to the Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Extended 
page, the filter watt.show.newSecurity is applied by default, forcing users to 
clear the filter in order to view all properties.

This issue is now resolved. 

DTS-2004 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix4)
In the "Add multiple extended settings" dialog box, clicking the info icon
displays the tooltip text twice. 

On the Settings > Extended settings page in Integration Server Administrator,
clicking Batch Add opens the "Add multiple extended settings" dialog. Clicking
the info icon results in the display of two copies of the tooltip text. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2009 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix4)
In Integration Server Administrator, the Monitoring page must display the 
Custom Context ID column in the Services Executions table by default, instead 
of hiding the column. 

This issue is now resolved. 

DTS-1815 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix3)
Cosmetic change to the Search dialog box for the Messaging log in Integration
Server Administrator. 

DTS-1944 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix3)
Under certain conditions, the WmAdmin package > Integration Server 
Administrator > Monitoring page fails to display custom context IDs for the 
listed service executions.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-1954 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix3)
When editing a Cloud account, Integration Server Administrator displays the
breadcrumbs Administration > Accounts instead of Administration > Accounts >
Edit Account. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-75833 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix3)
Changes to the framework of the Integration Server Administrator API to allow
other Software AG products to deliver their APIs in a package's code/jars
directory and to unregister their APIs in a package's shutdown service. 

DTS-1655 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Clicking on part of a breadcrumb in Integration Server Administrator might result
in the error "Unknown service null".

This issue is now fixed. 

DTS-1724 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Service monitoring in the new Integration Server Administrator allows services
to be resubmitted even when they are not resbumittable. 

The Monitoring > Services page of the new Integration Server Administrator
indicated that all services were resbumittable even if they were not.
Consequently, Integration Server Administrator allowed a service to be
resubmitted even if it was not resbumittable. 

Now, the Monitoring > Services page correctly reflects which services are
resbumittable. Integration Server Administrator disables the Resubmit button
when a selected service is not resubmittable. 

DTS-1763 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
The Monitoring > Services page of the new Integration Server Administrator
displays the message "Monitoring service information is not available" even
though the 4 listed requirements have been met. 

This scenario occurs when the process audit database components are not present.
Service monitoring requires the process audit components even though process
runtime (PRT) is not installed. This requirement applies to any RDBMS that
supports service monitoring. 

To resolve this issue, create the process audit database components and assign
the process JDBC functions to the appropriate JDBC pool alias. For information,
see the guide "Installing Software AG Products On Premises". 

The displayed error message now includes the additional requirement about the
existence of process audit database components. 

DTS-1764 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Inconsistencies related to dates are observed on notifications, logs, dashboard
and monitoring pages in Integration Server Administrator when the browser's 
default locale is "English (New Zealand)".

These issues are resolved now. 

DTS-1788 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Integration Server Administrator fails to display a few Integration Server 
error messages.

The issue is now resolved.

DTS-1791 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Even when the WmCloud package is disabled, the navigation panel in Integration 
Server Administrator continues to display the enabled webMethods Cloud menu and 
its related components.

This issue is now resolved. The webMethods Cloud menu is disabled and the 
related components are not visible.

DTS-1809 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
While accessing Integration Server through an HTTPS port that requires client 
certifcates, Integration Server does not acknowledge the client certificate 
presented and prompts for entry of user credentials on the home page of the 
WmAdmin package.

This issue is now resolved. The fix requires installation of 
IS_10.11_Core_Fix3.

DTS-1827 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
In the new Integration Administration user interface, the Server log page does 
not reflect changes to the extended settings of the watt.server.log.maxEntries 
parameter.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72142 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Users defined in the Common Directory Service central users account cannot be
given read-only access to the Administrator API. 

To enable users with a common directory services to have read-only access to the
Administrator API, Integration Server introduces the following administrative
assets: 

- ReadOnlyAdministrators user group. All members of the ReadOnlyAdministrators
group have read-only access to the Administrator API. 
- ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL. Groups that are allowed access to the
ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL have read-only access to the Administrator API. The
new group ReadOnlyAdministrstors have access to the ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL. 

To give a local user (a user defined on Integration Server) read-only access to
the Administrator API, add the user to the ReadOnlyAdministrators group. 
To give a user in the Central Directory Service read-only access to the API, add
the group to which the user belongs to the ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL. 

The first time the WmAdmin package loads after applying a fix that includes
PIE-72142, Integration Server does the following: 

- Creates the ReadOnlyAdministrators user group if it does not exist.
Adds the users belonging to the group set as the value of the
watt.adminapi.group.readOnly server configuration parameter to the
ReadOnlyAdministrators user group. 
- Deletes the user group specified in the watt.adminapi.group.readOnly
parameter. 
- Creates the ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL and adds the ReadOnlyAdministartors
group to the allowed list for this ACL. 
- Deletes the watt.adminapi.group.readOnly server configuration parameter as it
is no longer needed. 

Note: Integration Server allows all users to access the OpenAPI file for a
product using the GET /admin/swagger/{productName} operation. 

PIE-73267 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Integration Server displays a message stating "[ISS.0030.0200] Logger
mediatorTransaction is not a valid audit logger name". 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74293 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Integration Server does not accept a value of "webMethods" for the
watt.server.http.returnException configuration parameter but should. 

This issue has been resolved.

PIE-72380 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
The new Integration Server Administrator has incorrect titles and breadcrumbs 
when CSRF Guard is enabled.

These issues are now resolved.

DTS-1569 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
When CSRF guard is enabled, many breadcrumbs and dynamic server pages (DSPs) 
are displaying incorrect information and sometimes extra breadcrumbs are 
displayed. 

When CSRF guard is enabled, the titles and breadcrumbs for some of the DSP 
pages are incorrect. The title will be close to correct; for example, the title 
may be "Licensing details" when it should be "Edit licensing details". The 
breadcrumbs will also be very close to correct; however, there may be an 
additional breadcrumb or one less breadcrumb in the list. These problems are 
not present if CSRF guard is disabled. 

These issues are now resolved.

DTS-1524 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
When Integration Server runs inside container with path-based routing, the user 
cannot login to Integration Server and Integration Sever Administrator does not 
work. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-1292 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
OpenID single sign-on does not work when using the new Administration Console. 

When accessing the new Administration Console directly using https://serverHost:
openid-port/WmAdmin/, OpenID single sign-on does not happen instead a basic 
login dialog is shown. 

This issue is now resolved. Accessing https://serverHost:openid-port/WmAdmin/ 
starts the OpenID single sign-on and shows the dashboard at the completion.

DTS-1520 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
Some pages in Integration Server Administrator have incorrect titles, 
breadcrumbs, and links to help topics.
 
These issues are resolved now.

DTS-1527 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
Incorrect page titles and breadcrumbs on 'Tenant connections' pages in 
Integration Server Administrator. 

In Integration Server Administrator > webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections, 
clicking 'Create Tenant Connection' or an existing tenant connection shows the 
page title as 'Tenant Connections' and breadcrumb as 'Administration > Tenant 
connections', which are incorrect. 

The issue is now resolved. Clicking 'Create Tenant Connection' displays the 
link name as the page title and 'Administration > Tenant connections > Create 
Tenant Connection' as the breadcrumb. Similarly, clicking an existing tenant 
connection shows 'Edit Tenant Connection' as the page title and 
'Administration > Tenant connections > Edit Tenant Connection' as the 
breadcrumb.

DTS-1537 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
If the user is required to create a new password upon first log in and the 
user's first session expires before the user changes the password, the user is 
denied access on subsequent attempts to log in. 

When a user is required to create a new password upon initial log in with the 
default password and the user does not change the password before the session 
becomes idle (for example, the Change Password dialog box is left open), the 
session times out on the server. If the user then attempts to change the 
password, an expired session causes the attempt to fail and the Change Password 
dialog box remains open. However, the user cannot use the Change Password 
dialog box to set a new password if the session is expired. The user must close 
the dialog box and then re-log in with the default password before a new 
password can be provided. 

Now, Integration Server closes the Change Password dialog after an attempt to 
change a password fails due to an expired session.

DTS-1570 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
A browser displays the native login prompt upon entering incorrect credentials 
on the Microservices Runtime login page. 

Entering incorrect credentials on the Microservices Runtime login page displays 
the browser's native login prompt. The user can close the prompt by either 
cancelling the dialog or entering the login credentials, followed by re-
entering the login credentials on the underlying page. 

This issue is resolved now.

DTS-1607 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
An attempt to shut down or restart Integration Server or view packages or
updates results in an error when CSRF is enabled.

In Integration Server Administrator, actions such as shutdown or restart, or
viewing packages or updates on the About page result in an error indicating
that the CSRF token is invalid.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-1609 (IS_10.11_WmAdmin_Fix1)
Clicking the "Try the New Administration Console" link on the legacy 
Integration Server Administration requires the user to log in again. 

After logging into the legacy Integration Server Administrator, clicking the 
"Try the New Administration Console" link goes to the login screen and require 
the user to log in again. 

This issue is now resolved. Clicking the "Try the New Administration Console" 
link does not prompt the user to log in again to access the new Integration 
Server Administrator.
