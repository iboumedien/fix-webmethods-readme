5.0 Platform Support

webMethods Integration Server 10.11 Core Fix 16 is supported on the same platforms, 
operating systems, and Java Runtime Environments (JREs) as webMethods Integration 
Server 10.11.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

If Integration Server uses central user management, which is provided through 
My webMethods Server, you must keep the common libraries provided by My
webMethods Server up to date. To obtain the current changes to the common
libraries, install the latest My webMethods Server fix located under Common 
Libraries in Software AG Update Manager.

IS 10.11 Core Fix12 (or higher) and IS 10.11 WmAdmin Fix10 (or higher) are 
interdependent. Therefore, install both the fixes together.

If ActiveTransfer is a layered product for the Integration Server to which
IS_10.11_Core_Fix3 fix or higher is applied, you must apply webMethods
ActiveTransfer Server 10.11 Fix 4 (MAT_10.11_Server_Fix4) or higher as well.
This requirement is due to changes made in PIE-70913 to resolve security issues.
If the ActiveTransfer fix is not applied, authentication for an ActiveTransfer
user will fail.

The steps for uninstalling Integration Server Core 10.11 Fix 15 
(IS_10.11_Core_Fix15), vary depending on the previous fix level. See section 
9.0 Uninstallation for more details.

After installing the 10.11 Core Fix 8 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8) or higher, install 
IS 10.11 ABE Fix3 (IS_10.11_ABE_Fix3) or higher to ensure that the 
Deployer-related changes for PIE-79351 work. 

After applying the 10.11 Core Fix 9 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9) or higher, 
IS 10.11 ABE Fix4 (IS_10.11_ABE_Fix4) or higher needs to be installed. 
PIE-77771 introduces mavericks jar to ABE environment which is required 
for successful building of ABE assets.

Applying IS_10.11_Core_Fix9 or higher resolves PIE-81171. However, PIE-81171  
introduces the WmCloud package changes in IS_10.11_WmCloud_Fix4. Therefore, 
install IS_10.11_Core_Fix15 and IS_10.11_WmCloud_Fix4 together.

Application of a fix that includes PIE-73733 upgrades Apache Lucene libraries. 
Upgrading the Apache Lucene libraries requires a repository purge and rebuild to 
use a newer binary format. Update Manager performs this purge automatically as 
a post-install task. Upon restart, Integration Server rebuilds the repository 
index using the newer binary format. However, when uninstalling a fix that 
includes PIE-73733 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3 and higher), Update Manager does not 
perform an automatic purge of the repository. For Integration Server to 
rebuild the repository upon restart, the repository must be deleted manually. 
Therefore, after uninstalling a fix that includes PIE-73733, manually 
remove the files from <installPath>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instanceName>/monitorRepo/core/index 
and then start Integration Server. Upon restart, Integration Server rebuilds the 
repository index using the older binary format.  If files are not removed 
prior to starting Integration Server, the Dashboard in Integration Server 
Administrator may have missing data and the server log may include errors such 
as the following:
 
[ISS.0045.9998C] (tid=410) Exception --> [ISS.0045.0044] Failed to open index 
in create/overwrite mode. Details: Format version is not supported  



7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-83187
The pub.document:documentToXMLValues service inaccurately encodes Asian language
characters in the input. 

This issue is now resolved by introducing the
watt.server.support.asianLangCharEncoding server configuration parameter. Set
the parameter to true to ensure that the 
pub.document:documentToXMLValues service properly encodes Asian language
characters in the input. Set the parameter to false to encode Asian language
characters like the rest of the input. 

Note: If your input contains 4-byte Japanese characters, the service 
may not produce the desired output if you do not set the parameter to true.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-83308
SFTP file listing based on file filters does not work in Integration Server.

When Integration Server uses the version 2 SFTP client, the "pub.client.sftp:ls"
service 
does not list the file types mentioned using the file filter in the path input
parameter of the service. 
For example, *.xml, *.txt and so on.

This issue is now resolved. However, Java regular expressions are not supported.

PIE-86473
Integration Server incorrectly handles REST requests in JSON format
when they have missing inputs.

When Integration Server processes REST requests in the JSON format, the missing
inputs that do not allow null values are present in the processing pipeline with
null values, which is incorrect.

This issue is now resolved by introducing the
watt.server.rest.addNullForMissingInput server configuration parameter that
controls how Integration Server handles missing inputs in a REST request.
The default value is true, which sets the missing input to null.
When the parameter is set to false, Integration Server does not set the missing
input to null.

You must restart Integration Server for the changes to take effect.

PIE-86812
Integration Server 10.5 blocks incoming payload requests that include certain
file types (for example, .pdf or .png) within multipart/form-data as SQL
injection violation. 

Integration Server blocks payload requests containing specific file types 
(for example, .pdf or .png) as an SQL injection violation. Moreover, if 
incoming payload requests include such file types within multipart/form-data,
Integration Server 10.5 blocks the request at Enterprise Gateway because
multipart/form-data is not supported by the Enterprise Gateway rules. 

The issue is now resolved. If you want to instruct Integration Server to 
bypass validation for any specific content type against the SQL injection, use 
watt.server.enterprisegateway.SQLinjection.ignoreContentType system
configuration parameter. 

PIE-86896
Disconnecting a client, such as Designer, from Integration Server can sometimes
take a long time. 

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-87359
Integration Server generates a configuration file for the WmAssetPublisher
package even when the package is unavailable.

Despite safely deleting the WmAssetPublisher package, Integration Server
generates the assetpublisher.cnf file in packages/WmAssetPublisher/config at
some point after restart. However, generating the configuration file when the
package is absent is incorrect. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87807
Integration Server does not collect UM client logs and integrationlive 
configurations as part of diagnostics data. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server includes the umClient.log files 
and the .cnf files from config/integrationlive in the diagnostics.

PIE-87813
Missing response body for undefined HTTP status codes.

When an OpenAPI document specifies a "default" schema for HTTP status codes, the
schema should be used for the response body of any undefined HTTP responses.
Therefore, if the service's output aligns with the default response body for an
undefined HTTP status code, the client should receive this default response
body. However, the response body is missing in such scenarios. 
 
This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87862
Designer experiences delay while rendering the pipeline view for a map step.

The lack of an option to cache the missing or non-existent nodes 
impacts the performance of Designer while rendering the pipeline 
view for a map step.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides an option 
to enable the cache for non-existent nodes with a cache expiry time.

Note:
Install this fix with the corresponding Designer fix (WED-10465
(ESB_10.11_Fix7)) to resolve the issue. 

PIE-87888
The pub.client.sftp:login service retains the previously accessed directory
information when reuseSession parameter is true.

When using the pub.client.sftp:login service with the reuseSession parameter
set to true, Integration Server presents the directory last accessed in the
previous session to the user instead of the user's home directory.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-88032
Changes to a GraphQL descriptor are visible after refreshing the descriptor but
are not persisted after reloading the package.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-88082
Integration Server fails to receive the reply document from a specific 
client when using the pub.publish:deliverAndWait service.

When invoking the pub.publish:deliverAndWait service with the async 
flag set to true, Integration Server does not receive the reply document from
the client. The issue occurs only during the asynchronous request or reply
operations for messaging triggers. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-88168
In an Enterprise Gateway setup with Enterprise Gateway rules configured, when a
client invokes an API with the "Expect: 100-continue" HTTP header and without
the payload, Integration Server throws SocketReadTimeout exception and the request
fails.

The issue is resolved. Integration Server now responds with "HTTP/1.1 100
Continue" to the client, allowing the client to send the payload for further
processing in Enterprise Gateway.

PIE-88272
Addition of server configuration parameter to prevent a deadlock when the
Statistics Data Collector inserts metrics. 

When the Statistics Data Collector inserts metrics data into the database and
the transaction hangs indefinitely, it can lead to high thread usage in
Integration Server which can adversely affect performance. This could occur if a
database table needed for the completion of the metrics data transaction is
locked by another process. 

To prevent this potential deadlock, Integration Server now includes the
following server configuration parameter for setting a timeout for data
insertion: 

watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.dbInsert.secsTimeout
Specifies the number of seconds that the Statistics Data Collector waits when
attempting to insert metrics into the database. After the timeout elapses,
Integration Server writes a debug level message to the server log about the
timeout and discards the metrics event. Once the insertion timeout occurs, the
Statistics Data Collector writes metrics to memory until the database issue
resolves or the Statistics Data Collector is disabled. After the database issue
resolves, the Statistics Data Collector inserts the queued events into the
database. Set to a positive integer or 0 (zero). A value of 0 indicates that
there is no timeout and the Statistics Data Collector will wait indefinitely to
complete the transaction for inserting metrics into the database. The default is
15 seconds. 

Do not specify a timeout value greater than the statistics data collection
interval as this may cause thread utilization for the Statistics Data Collector
to increase. The statistics data collection interval is determined by the
watt.server.stats.pollTime and has a default value of 60 seconds. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

PIE-88346
Journal events are not being logged.

The Event Manager in Integration Server invokes event handlers that subscribe to
specific types of events. However, Integration Server did not log Journal
events, preventing execution of event handlers that subscribed to Journal
events. 

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-88415
Integration Server fails to create a connection to an SFTP server when the SFTP
user alias is created based on values in the application.properties file.

When the application.properties file specifies the authentication type as
public key for an SFTP user, and the SFTP client version as v1,
Integration Server fails to create a connection to an SFTP server and throws
NullPointerException but succeeds when the SFTP client version is v2.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-88464
The pub.smime.keystore:createSignedData service does not validate the
key usage of the certificate used to generate digital signature.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-88496
Updating the monitoring directory by applying a configuration variables template
(application.properties) changes the access mode for the file polling port. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-88566
The pub.xml:queryXMLNode service trims leading and trailing whitespaces
in the query result.

The service must return the content of the queried field in the XML node
without modifications. However, the service trims the spaces around the
field content.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the
watt.client.node.trimBlanks server configuration parameter, which determines
whether the service trims the leading and trailing whitespaces or retains them.
Set the parameter to false to retain and true to trim the white spaces.
The default value for the parameter is true.

You do not need to restart the server for changes to the parameter to take
effect. 

PIE-88923
Integration Sever Administrator displays a misleading cluster status of
"Off" when the server is configured to be part of a cluster and the
Terracotta Server Array is not available. 

Now, Integration Sever Administrator displays a status of "Off" with the
additional text "Cluster is not working" displayed below the status when the
Terracotta Server Array is not available for a configured cluster. 

PIE-92334
Integration Server has a security vulnerability that allows a
Developer user to create a user and grant administrator privileges.

A user with Developer privileges can create a scheduled task using a
built-in service to add a user and run the task, even without permission
to invoke the service. Similarly, the Developer user can add a user
to the Administrators group making Integration Server vulnerable
to security risks.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the
watt.server.scheduler.checkUserAcl server configuration parameter
to validate a user invoking the service in a scheduled task.

watt.server.scheduler.checkUserAcl
Indicates whether Integration Server verifies if a user has Execute ACL
permission for a scheduler service. Set this parameter to true to enable
the verification or false to disable it. The default value is true.

You do not need to restart the server for the changes to the parameter
to take effect.

PIE-92369
The wm.xslt.File:save service in Integration Server has an access control flaw
that exposes the server to security risks.

A developer user has Execute ACL permission for the wm.xslt.File:save service,
allowing the user to perform sensitive administrative tasks, making the server
insecure.

This issue is resolved. Now, only administrator users have the Execute ACL
permissions for the wm.xslt.File:save service.

PIE-92557
Missing null values in OpenAPI-based connector responses.

When you run an OpenAPI-based connector service, if the JSON response from the
REST API contains an array with a field that has a null value, the connector
output should also include the field with the null value. However, the null
value field is missing from the connector response. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92579
Creating a Document Type in Designer fails.

Creating a Document Type in Designer from an UTF-8 encoded XML file fails if the 
file has two-byte UTF-8 characters.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92600
Upgrade of the bc-fips JAR to resolve known security vulnerabilities.

The bc-fips JAR included with Integration Server has been upgraded to version
1.0.2.5 from 1.0.2.4

PIE-92776
The "watt.server.portQueue" server configuration parameter has the incorrect
default value of 65534 instead of 200.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92842
Integration Server experiences memory issues (high resource and memory 
consumption) during design time activities such as copy, paste, rename, and so
on. 

Designer and webMethods.io show slow response times during design time
activities such as copy, paste, rename, and so on with hundreds of document type
references, resulting in high resource and memory consumption. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server performs better by optimizing
the flow service operations to minimize memory usage. 

PIE-92928
Integration Server returns an "HTTP 404 Not Found" error to
an OpenAPI request with "/" as the operation path.

For an OpenAPI request with "/" as the operation path,
Integration Server returns the "HTTP 404 Not Found" error instead
of the expected response.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92992
Automatic log rotation fails with an java.nio.file.FileSystemException.

Log rotation was not atomic, resulting in multiple threads attempting to read
and write to the log file at the same time. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93055
Integration Server experiences performance degradation when
parsing large JSON text after upgrading Jackson libraries.

After upgrading the Jackson libraries to 2.16.x, Integration Server
slows down significantly when parsing large JSON text.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93124
Integration Server intermittently throws a java.net.SocketException.

For an Integration Server on which API Gateway runs, Integration Server 
intermittently throws the following exception under high request load conditions.

java.net.SocketException: Socket output is already shutdown

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-93300
In Integration Server Administrator, the "Max Server Threads" term on the
Clustering page misleads users.

This issue is resolved. Now, "Max Server Threads" is changed to
"Max Service Instances".

PIE-93338
Integration Server does not include security headers in HTTP responses.
 
When the legacy Integration Server Administrator
(http://localhost:{port}/WmRoot) 
receives an anonymous HTTP request and returns an "ACCESS DENIED" response,  
Integration Server does not include security headers such as HTTP Strict
Transport Security (HSTS) in those responses.
 
This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93450
API Gateway sends mixed responses to HTTP requests under heavy load,
when reverse invoke is enabled.

API gateway mixes up certain responses for HTTP requests forwarded to
internal Integration Server under heavy load, when reverse invoke is enabled.

This issue is resolved now.

PIE-93629
Importing an OpenAPI document causes StackOverflowError . 

When creating a consumer REST API Descriptor (RAD) by importing
an OpenAPI document, if the operation response definition includes
headers with a recursive schema, Integration Server throws StackOverflowError. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93791
Metering.csv file is created even when the metering simulator is disabled.

When watt.server.metering.simulator.enabled is set to false, the metering
simulator is disabled. Integration Server creates the metering.csv file when the
metering simulator is disabled but should not. 
 
This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93849
Integration Server generates an additional variable if the input for 
a REST API contains a document array at the root level.

For a REST API, if the input includes a document array at the root
level, the pipeline receives an additional variable named $rootArray.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93865
The pub.report:runTemplate service can return the contents of files located
outside of the specified input package but should not. 

Now the pub.report:runTemplate service can only return the contents of files in
the templates or pub directories for the package specified in the $package input
parameter. 

PIE-94167
Integration Server fails to create a consumer or provider REST API
Descriptor (RAD) from an OpenAPI document.

When you create a consumer or provider RAD from an OpenAPI 
document, if the document contains two equivalent paths with 
different HTTP methods, Integration Server throws the following error:

Failed to create REST API descriptor. Reason: The OpenAPI document
contains equivalent paths.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-85358 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
When a user with Administrator privileges clicks a link to Integration Server
from Command Central, Integration Server displays the login page for Integration
Server Administrator instead of showing the Dashboard. 

This issue is resolved.

PIE-85549 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server names the root element of REST definitions
in a resource-first REST API Descriptor (RAD) in an unexpected manner.

For a resource-first RAD, if services have associated document types, 
Integration Server generates REST definitions for each document type referenced
in the Swagger document. The REST definition is named after the node name of
the document type. For example, if a document type A references document type B
with the variable name abc, the generated Swagger document automatically
generates a request or response for this operation in the Swagger editor. For
XML media types, the root element in the XML is the REST definition name, which
corresponds to the document type name. However, some users might expect the
variable name to be the root element in the autogenerated request or response. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server adds an XML tag for the REST 
definitions where the XML name property has the value as the variable name
to ensure that the auto-generated root XML name is the variable name and not
the node name. 

PIE-85555 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Login failure in Integration Server Administrator with HTTP 500 error.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-85738 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
REQMOD requests from Integration Server to an ICAP Server fail with
HTTP 400 Bad Request error.

This issue is now resolved. The HTTP response header is now removed from REQMOD
requests and the req-body position in the encapsulated header is re-calculated. 

PIE-86235 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
A request to send an empty file to an FTPS server using the pub.client.ftp:put
service in Integration Server results in an exception.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-86384 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server working as an ICAP-compliant client throws 'Error in reading
header from ICAP server response' for McAfee ICAP server because the
response header is blank.

This issue is resolved. Now, only the first line of the ICAP HTTP response is
read. 
For example, 'HTTP/1.1 403 VirusFound' if a virus is found and 'GET / HTTP/1.1'
if a virus is not found.

PIE-86607 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
After upgrading the Mavericks JAR, Integration Server does not use the
sftpLicenseKey.cnf file in the IntegrationServer\instances\default\config\sftp
folder of the installation. Therefore, the file is removed.

PIE-86690 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
The internal service wm.server:connect returns sensitive information about the
server to an anonymous user. 

The internal service wm.server:connect now returns limited information such as
host and version. The service no longer returns detailed information about the
server. 

PIE-86815 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
The sample.xslt:transformToString service in the WmXSLT package is susceptible 
to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

This issue is now resolved by introducing the watt.core.xml.loadExternalEntities 
server configuration parameter with the default value as false. 
If the parameter is set to false, the service ignores any external entities 
referenced in the input.

Note: If the parameter is set to true, the service parses the external entity 
references, which makes Integration Server vulnerable to XXE injection.

You do not need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.

PIE-87029 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server throws NullPointerException when the 
pub.schema:validate service fails to validate an IData object 
against an IS document type created from references in a 
JSON schema definition.
 
This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87072 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server generates duplicate REST definitions for multiple services 
that use the same document.   
 
In a resource-first approach, when multiple services use the same document in
input and output, Integration Server should generate a single REST definition
for the document. However, Integration Server generates multiple or duplicate
REST definitions, causing the issue. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87136 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server throws an exception while creating a docType from an XML 
schema definition (XSD) due to the absence of prefix for the XML namespace in a 
field within the XSD.

While creating a docType using an XSD extracted from a generated Web Services 
Description Language (WSDL) file, if the XSD has a field that contains the XML 
namespace but without an assigned prefix for the namespace, Integration Server 
throws the following exception:

[ISC.0124.9017] Document to XSD error: Field testField cannot be represented 
in XML Schema. The field contains an XML Namespace property but the field name 
does not contain a prefix.

This issue is resolved by introducing the following server configuration 
parameter.

watt.core.schema.ignoreFieldNamespacePrefix

Specifies whether Integration Server ignores the absence of a prefix for the XML 
namespace in a field within the XSD while creating a docType using an XSD from 
a generated WSDL file. When set to true, Integration Server ignores the absence 
of the prefix, enabling Integration Server to create a docType without any
error. 
The default is false.

Integration Server restart is not required for changes to the parameter to 
take effect.

PIE-87159 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Sever does not explicitly set the type for an object schema while 
generating a Swagger document.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87237 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
The Messaging > webMethods Trigger page displays "Broker Not Configured" for
the Maximum Threads field even though a connection to the Broker is configured. 

Even after configuring a Broker connection alias, the Messaging > webMethods
Trigger page displays "Broker Not Configured" for the Maximum Threads field
until at least on webMethods messaging trigger has been created. 

Now, the Messaging > webMethods Trigger page displays N/A for the Maximum
Threads field if a Broker connection alias is configured but a webMethods
messaging trigger that uses the alias has not yet been created. 

PIE-87255 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Updated Guava jar file.

The Guava jar file included with Integration Server is now updated to
32.1.1.jre. 
The previous version was guava-32.0.0-jre.

This resolves the following security vulnerability: CVE-2023-2976

PIE-87256 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Jetty libraries prior to version 9.4.53 have security vulnerabilities.
This issue is now resolved by upgrading the libraries to 9.4.53.

PIE-87371 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server incorrectly transforms IData to JSON and vice versa
during runtime.

Consider a REST API Descriptor (RAD) created by importing an OpenAPI document
with a composed schema of primitive datatypes as a provider or consumer. During

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87897 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server experiences slow response time for HTTP or HTTPS client calls

configuration for the global or port IP access delaying the response from 
Integration Server to the client, resulting in slow response time for HTTP or 
HTTPS client calls during the SSL connection.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server performs a reverse DNS lookup 
only after verifying the "Access Mode" setting and the configuration of 
IP access lists for specific ports or globally.

PIE-82194 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix14)
Scheduled tasks in Integration Server are stuck in the Active state with 
Next Run value as 0.0.

When a scheduled task fails to run before the Next Run time elapses, the task 
remains in the Active state with the Next Run value as 0.0, which does not show 
that the scheduled task is delayed.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the 
watt.server.scheduler.nextRun.hidePastValue server configuration parameter 
that specifies how Integration Server displays the elapsed Next Run time for a 
scheduled task that fails to run before the Next Run time elapses. If the 
parameter is set to true, the Next Run time shown as 0.0. 
If the parameter is set to false, the Next Run time is shown with a negative
sign, indicating the delay in running the scheduled task. The default value is 
true.

You do not need to restart the Integration Server for changes to the parameter
to take effect.

PIE-83490 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix14)
Integration Server incorrectly displays the XML attributes in a generated 
Swagger document.

A Swagger document generated by Integration Server includes fields that start
with '@' instead of treating the fields as attributes in the following
situation: 

- The REST API Descriptor (RAD) is created from a service with a signature that
contains document types defined using XML schemas (that is, 
the XML content type properties are defined).
- The document type includes one or more variables with a name that begins with
the '@' symbol. 
Now, Integration Sever treats the fields that begin with the '@' symbol as
attributes in the generated Swagger document and will include an XML property
definition for such fields. The fields are returned as attributes during runtime
if the media type is in XML format. 

Important:
The variables starting with '@' are treated as an attribute only if the XML 
Content type property is set for the variable. If the variable name starts with 
'@' and the XML content type is not set, then the resulting Swagger document
includes a field name that starts with '@'.

PIE-84869 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix14)
Integration Server has scheduler issues in quiesce mode.

Consider a scheduled task that is active when Integration Server enters quiesce
mode. If the scheduled task is updated in quiesce mode, Integration Server
suspends the task. Upon exiting quiesce mode, the task remains suspended. 

This issue is resolved. Now, tasks that are active before Integration Server 
enters quiesce mode will remain active when Integration Server exits quiesce 
mode.

Additionally, when Integration Server enters quiesce mode, the order of
package unloading is changed. Integration Server now unloads custom packages
before system packages, regardless of the package dependencies defined for the
custom packages.

data from the previous statistics collection interval. 

Previously, the data displayed for sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis and
sag_is_service_requests_total could be more than 5 minutes in the past. 

Now, the metrics display data from the previous statistics collection interval
which ensures that the data is no older than 2 minutes. 

PIE-85423 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix14)
Integration Server incorrectly names the first server log file after
a rollover.

When configuring size-based rollover for server log using the 
watt.server.serverlogRotateSize server configuration parameter, 
Integration Server incorrectly uses the previous day's date in the 
filename of the first log file after the rollover.

This issue is resolved. Integration Server now uses the current date in 
the filename of the first server log file after the rollover.

PIE-85485 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix14)
Integration Server incorrectly sets the default Content-Type header in  
POST or DELETE requests, even when the client does not specify the header.

Despite the absence of the Content-Type header in POST or DELETE requests, the 
pub.client:http service explicitly sets the header to the default value: 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded". However, according to HTTP 1.1, 
specifying the Content-Type header is optional. Therefore, if the client does
not include the header in the request, the pub.client:http service should not 
add it. 

The issue is now resolved by introducing the 'watt.server.http.setDefaultContentType' 
server configuration parameter, which determines whether Integration Server sets 
the default Content-Type header in the requests. If the parameter value is true, 
Integration Server sets the default Content-Type header in the request even 
though the client does not include it. If the parameter value is false,
Integration Server does not set the default Content-Type header, when it is 
originally absent in the request.

The default value of the parameter is true. However, Integration Server 
automatically sets the Content-Type header to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
when data is passed to the pub.client:http service using the 'args' or 'table'
keys, irrespective of the 'watt.server.http.setDefaultContentType' parameter 
value.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect.

While processing results from a SQL query, the Statistics Data Collector might
emit many log messages if a java.sql.SQLException is repeatedly raised while
retrieving data  This results in an inordinate number of messages in the server
log such as the following:

Integration Server attempts to restart such triggers at an interval of 30 
seconds. Furthermore, If you deploy a a new version of the package that does not
contain the JMS trigger anymore and do not restart Integration Server,
Integration Server attempts to restart failed triggers that no longer exist. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-85675 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix14)
Security vulnerability during FTP session.
 
During an FTP session (inbound or outbound), Integration Server exposes the
admin and ns folders in packages, making Integration Server vulnerable to a
script injection. 
 
To address this security vulnerability, Integration Server includes a server
configuration parameter to hide the admin and ns folders in all packages. Set
watt.net.ftp.hide.folders to true to hide the admin and ns folders in packages
during an FTP session. Set to false to leave the admin and ns folders visible
during FTP sessions. The default is false to ensure backward compatibility with
existing solutions. 
 
You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 
 
Important! The default configuration of the new watt.net.ftp.hide.folders
parameter does not resolve the security vulnerability. After applying a fix that
includes PIE-85675, you must set watt.net.ftp.hide.folders to true to address
the security vulnerability. It is more secure to set watt.net.ftp.hide.folders
to true.

WmRoot package finishes loading: 
 
[ISS.0045.0364D] (tid=<threadID>) Statistics Data Collector is waiting for

Client applications can now set the User-Agent value that JSONClient sends to
Integration Server. 

When the CSRF Guard feature is enabled on Integration Server and the
watt.net.userAgent property has been changed to something other than the default
value of "webMethods", a call from the JSONClient class to the Integration
Server results in an  HTTP 400 response code. 

To resolve this issue, the following methods have been added to
com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient: 

    public void setUserAgent(String)
    public String getUserAgent()

Client applications that use JSONClient to communicate with Integration Server
can call the setUserAgent method to specify the value that JSONClient will send
in the User-Agent request header. If setUserAgent() is not called, or is passed
null or an empty String, JSONClient will send a User-Agent value of
"webMethods". If Integration Server is using CSRF Guard, client applications
should set JSONClient's User-Agent so that it matches the watt.net.userAgent
setting on the server. If Integration Server has watt.server.http.jsonFormat set
to stream or bytes, the User-Agent value sent by JSONClient must be webMethods.
Client applications can call the getUserAgent method to see what User-Agent
value is currently in use by JSONClient.

resume the trigger. However, Integration Server continues to create additional
instances of the service before the previous instances end, leading to resource
exhaustion. 

This issue is now resolved.

Outlook cannot open emails encrypted and sent by Integration Server.

If the pub.smime:createEncryptedData service is used to encrypt a MIME message
which is then sent using the pub.client:smtp service, Outlook receives the
message but cannot read it. Outlook might display the following message:
"Cannot open this item. A private key to decrypt the document is missing!"
This issue occurs because the pub.smime:createEncryptedData service creates a
MIME message that cannot be decrypted by Outlook. Specifically the MIME message
created by the service includes an extra line between headers. 

The pub.smime:createEncryptedData service no longer includes the extra line

If there is an issue during the global variable substitution in a flow service, 
Integration Server throws a FlowException. The FlowException is not handled 
by the CATCH block even if the flow service contains a TRY-CATCH block, leading 
to the abrupt termination of the flow service.

This issue is resolved by introducing the following server configuration

watt.server.globalVariables.throwServiceException
Specifies how Integration Server handles exceptions when global variable 
substitution in a flow service fails. When set to true Integration Server 
throws a ServiceException. When set to false Integration Server throws a

$service, $pipeline, $user, $timestamp, and $contextID. 

Integration Server already includes the watt.server.http.returnException server
configuration parameter which determines whether the $stacktrace is returned to
the client along with the $error (the error message). This fix introduces new
values for watt.server.http.returnException which provide more control over what
information is returned to the calling client. The new values are: 

- brief - Returns all of the fields with the exception of $stackTrace.
- message - Returns $error and $contextID (context ID used for audit logging)
only. This is the most secure option as it returns the least amount of
information. 
- verbose - Returns all of the fields. This is the default.
- webMethods - Returns all of the fields only if the client's HTTP user agent is
set to webMethods or has the same value as the user agent specified in the
watt.net.userAgent parameter. If the user agent in the HTTP request does not
match the watt.net.userAgent value, the response contains $error and $contextID
only. Do not set watt.server.http.returnException to webMethods in a production
environment. A request submitted with the header "User-agent: webMethods" would
return sensitive information that could be misused. 

Note: Previously, the watt.server.http.returnException parameter accepted values
of true and false. These values are still honored. A value of true corresponds
to verbose. A value of false corresponds to brief. 

Note: If a service explicitly sets a response body by invoking
pub.flow:setResponse or pub.flow:setResponse2 and that service end with an
exception, the HTTP response will have a 500 status code but will not contain
the error message, stack trace, or other exception details. The response body
contains only what was set by invoking pub.flow:setResponse or
pub.flow:setResponse2.

Integration Server does a reverse DNS lookup during an SSL connection. 

Integration Server does a reverse DNS lookup during an SSL connection with
a client despite having the client's IP address in the "Allow" list for 
port-specific IP access or global IP access.

This issue is resolved by introducing the following server configuration 
parameters:

- watt.server.ipaccess.disableRDNSLookup.ports
Specifies whether Integration Server should perform a reverse DNS lookup during 
an SSL connection with a client, if the client IP address is in the "Allow" list 
for the port-specific IP access. When set to "true", Integration Server disables 
  the reverse DNS lookup during an SSL connection. The default is false.

- watt.server.ipaccess.disableRDNSLookup.global
Specifies whether Integration Server should perform a reverse DNS lookup during 
an SSL connection with a client, if the client IP address is in the "Allow" list 
  for the global IP access. When set to "true", Integration Server disables the 
  reverse DNS lookup during an SSL connection. The default is false.

Now, the /metrics endpoint returns only a single instance of the
sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis and sag_is_service_requests_total
metrics for each IS service. 

Additionally, JVM and server metrics are now based on current data at the time

PIE-84507 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix13)
Decoding failure that occurs because the Protocol Buffer descriptor used with
the webMethods messaging trigger cannot be found will now be treated as a
transient error. 

When a webMethods messaging trigger receives a message encoded as a protocol
buffer, the trigger needs the protocol buffer descriptor created for the
publishable document type to decode the message. If the publishable document
type is not loaded at the time of decoding, the decoding fails due to a
MessagingCoderException. The trigger treated the decoding failure as a fatal
error and acknowledged the message to the messaging provider. However, the
decoding failure might be a transient error in some situations, such as when the
package that contains the publishable document type has not yet loaded at the
time the trigger attempts decoding. 

To address this possibility, the trigger now treats a decoding failure that
occurs because the trigger cannot find the protocol buffer descriptor as a
transient error. If a MessagingCoderException occurs, Integration Server can
suspend the trigger and rollback the message when one of the following is true: 

- watt.server.trigger.preprocess.suspendAndRetryOnError=true
- The trigger is configured to suspend and retry later.

Rolling back the message to the provider makes it possible for the trigger to
receive and process the message again later.

When a client application makes an invalid HTTP request to Integration Server, 
the response to the request contains the invalid URL, which can be misused to 
perform a text injection attack by presenting a customized message to the
application. 

This issue is resolved. Integration Server provides the 
"watt.server.http.404.responseWithURL" server configuration parameter that 
controls the response messages to invalid HTTP requests. 

watt.server.http.404.responseWithURL

Specifies whether Integration Server adds the requested resource name to the 
404 response when a HTTP client sends an invalid URL request. If the parameter
is set to true, Integration Server responds with "Object Not Found (URL name)". 
If the parameter set to false, Integration Server responds with "Object Not
Found". The default value is true. 

You need not restart Integration Server for the changes to the parameter 
to take effect.

When you run the connector service without providing a value

PIE-85052 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix13)
Metering simulator now writes service metering log messages to a separate log
file. 

The metering simulator enables the logging of messages for services that would
be metered and therefore generate transcation data when the webMethods Metering
Agent is in use on Integration Server. Previously, the metering simulator wrote
logging data for metered services to the server log. Because the server log can
grow very large and contain data from all the subsystems in Integration Server,
log message for metered services can be hard to find. 

To make it easier to view and analyze service metering data, the metering
simulator now writes to the metering log file.  The metering log is a
comma-separated values file located in:
<IntegrationServer_directory>\instances\<instanceName>\logs 

The frequency with which the metering log rotates is determined by the
watt.server.statsLogRotateInterval, wich also controls the statistics log
rotation. Integration Server names the rotated log metering<timestamp>.csv. 

The metering log contains the following fields:
- timestamp - Timestamp at which the metering simulator wrote the log entry to
the metering log. 
- svcName - Name of the top-level service for which the metering simulator is
generating metrics. 
- tenant - The tenantID. If the tenant is null, such as in a self-hosted
runtime, the metering simulator inserts a blank space in the tenant field. 
- user - Name of the user that initiated the transaction.
- duration - Duration of the service, measured in milliseconds.
- trans_count - Number of transactions counted for this single service
invocation. If the duration is less than 3 seconds, the count will be 1. If the
duration exceeds 3 seconds, additional transactions will be counted for each 3
second interval. If your license key determines a different transaction duration
value, the simulator will use that value to determine the number of transactions 

Note: The fields in the metering log are similar to what the metering simulator
previously wrote to the server log with the following differences: 
- user information is now included
- cpu data is not included
- serviceName is now svcName
- transactions is now trans_count

media types in the Accept header, Integration Server returns the response as
text/html. 
 
This fix provides the watt.server.rest.useDefaultAccept server configuration 
parameter. When set to false, the parameter gives an option to support the 
existing behavior. When set to true, Integration Server returns the 
response based on the media type values defined in the RAD for the operation.
If one of the media type value in the Accept header is defined in the RAD,
Integration Server returns the response in the same format.
If there is a media type value in the Accept header that is not defined in the 
RAD, Integration Server returns the response in one of the format defined in

Issue while handling transient error processing.

You can configure Integration Server to retrieve multiple messages from
Universal Messaging for a JMS trigger with each request by using the prefetch
cache. You can enable the prefetch cache by setting the Max prefetch size
property to a value greater than 1 (in the trigger setting). However, the
feature is limited only to concurrent, non-transacted, and non-batched JMS
triggers. The prefetch functionality allows fetching multiple messages
simultaneously and processing them individually. 
Consider that a thread retrieves a batch of messages, and one of them remains
unacknowledged. In such a situation, Integration Server incorrectly indicates
that the remaining messages are acknowledged. These messages are redelivered
causing duplicate processing of the trigger. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server will skip processing the
remaining messages if any of the message from the prefetch batch is
unacknowledged.

Enhancement to customize the HTTP access log format.

You can now configure Integration Server to customize the HTTP access log by
specifying only the required fields from a predefined list in the order of your
preference. 
To configure Integration Server to write HTTP log entries according to your
preferences, the watt.server.httplog server configuration parameter now
accepts a new value, extended. The new server configuration parameter, 
watt.server.httplog.fields allow you to specify the required fields in the log.

watt.server.httplog.fields
Specifies a comma-separated list of fields that Integration Server logs in
the HTTP access log. You can specify the fields from a predefined list, and
in the required order.

For example,
watt.server.httplog=extended
watt.server.httplog.fields=uid(TEST_),'header/X-Forwarded-For',
timestamp(yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS),method,url,responseCode,serverIp,
clientIp,elapsedTime,responseSize

In the generated log, a space separates the values and the empty field values
are replaced by a hyphen. You can also specify values in double quotes ("") or
single quotes (''). If the provided field is not from the predefined list, then
Integration Server ignores the field.

The predefined list of fields:

uid (Unique ID for a log entry based on timestamp. You can also
prepend a prefix to the ID. For example, uid(SAG_))
host

PIE-81644 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Terracotta Server Array removes an Integration Server from the cluster due to
excessive session expirations. 

When a session expires, Integration Server updates the SessionStore cache which
is unnecessary because Ehcache manages expiration of cache elements.
Additionally, it creates work for the SessionStore cache. In a cluster, the
Integration Server update to the SessionStore cache generates unnecessary cache
event notifications that have to be processed by Integration Server. When this
load on the SessionStore cache is very high, Integration Server can become
temporarily unresponsive, causing the Terracotta Server Array to remove the
Integration Server instance from the cluster. 

This fix removes the unnecessary update by to the SessionStore cache made by
Integration Server when a session expires. In turn, this eliminates the cache
event notifications for session expiration, which improves server performance.
As a result, Integration Server will no longer be removed from a cluster due to
excessive session expiration processing.

The Statistics Data Collector now periodically checks the state of the JMV
statistics collector and restarts the JVM statistics collector if it has
stopped. 
 
Integration Server now also includes a server configuration parameter that
indicates how soon JVM statistics collection begins after Statistics Data
Collector starts up. 
 
watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.jvmStats.startSecs
Specifies when the Statistics Data Collector begins collecting JVM statistics
once Statistics Data Collector start up completes. The Statistics Data Collector
in Integration Server uses collected JVM statistics to populate the JVM metrics
tab in the Integration Server Administrator dashboard. Specify an integer
greater than or equal to 0.  A value of 0 indicates that JVM statistics
collection begins as soon as the Statistics Data Collector completes its

PIE-82224 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Resolved issues for webMethods messaging.
 
This fix addresses the following issues in webMethods messaging:

- The request-reply channel for a stateless Integration Server has a new ID
every time Integration Server starts. Over time, this results in a build-up of
request-reply channels on Universal Messaging. 
- Integration Server does not honor the value of the Enable Request-Reply
Channel and Listener check box. 
- Refreshing triggers is not thread safe and might cause messages to be stuck
until the Universal Messaging connection alias restarts. 

The following paragraphs provide more information about these changes.

Persisting of Request-Reply Channel ID for a Stateless Integration Server
In webMethods messaging, Integration Server uses a dedicated request-reply
channel and listener. The channel name includes a unique ID generated the first
time that Integration Server starts. However, if Integration Server is stateless
(for example, when running in a stateless container), the generated ID is not
saved to disk and does not persist across server restarts. This results in the
creation of new request-reply channel on Universal Messaging every time
Integration Server restarts. Over time, the unused channels build up on
Universal Messaging. (A stateful Integration Server persists the unique ID to
disk and uses the same request-replay channel name across restarts.) 

To prevent the build up of unused request-reply channels, Integration Server
provides a configuration option to automatically delete the request-reply
channel when the connection to Universal Messaging is lost. Set
watt.server.messaging.requestReply.useTempChannel to true to delete the
dedicated request-reply channel and listener shortly after the connection to
Universal Messaging is closed (this occurs when the alias is stopped). If the
connection to Universal Messaging is lost and then restored quickly (that is,
before the channel is deleted), Integration Server uses the same request-reply
channel. Setting watt.server.messaging.requestReply.useTempChannel to true
effectively makes the request-reply channel a temporary channel. Set
watt.server.messaging.requestReply.useTempChannel to false to keep the
request-reply channel on Universal Messaging across restarts of the Integration
Server. 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
Enable Request-Reply Channel and Listener check box
In Integration Server Administrator, the use of a dedicated request-reply
channel and listener can be configured on a per connection alias basis via the
Enable Request-Reply Channel and Listener check box. However, Integration Server
ignored the check box configuration and a dedicated channel and listener was
always used. 
Now, Integration Server honors the value of the Enable Request-Reply Channel and
Listener check box. If the check box is cleared, Integration Server does not use
a dedicated request-reply channel to retrieve replies to requests sent using the
connection alias. 
 
Thread Safety when Refreshing webMethods Messaging Triggers
When a channel is manually deleted or edited on Universal Messaging during
runtime and when an Integration Server is connected to the channel, Integration
Server refreshes the trigger automatically. However, the act of refreshing the
trigger is not thread-safe and could result in the creation of two listeners for
the same trigger on the channel. As a result, messages could get stuck in the
trigger queue and remain unprocessed until the messaging connection alias used
by the trigger was refreshed. This thread-safety issue could also occur when
Designer is used to edit a trigger. 

Now, refreshing a trigger in the above scenarios are thread-safe which prevents
messages from becoming stuck in the trigger queue. 

PIE-82296 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Integration Server takes a longer time to enter quiesce mode.

Entering quiesce mode, if there are shutdown services while disabling
packages, Integration Server waits for the shutdown services to reach
completion. If there are shutdown services that take longer time 
to complete, Integration Server waits indefinitely.

watt.server.quiesce.force

Specifies whether Integration Server disables a package forcefully. Set the 
parameter value to true to disable the packages forcefully. 
Forcefully disabling a package, terminates the running shutdown services.
Integration Server even terminates the threads for the user-scheduled tasks and
the user-triggered tasks before starting the package disabling. The default
value is false. 

watt.server.quiesce.force.timeout

Specifies the time in milliseconds that Integration Server waits to disable 
each package. If a shutdown service runs longer than the specified time, 
Integration Server terminates the shutdown service. The default value is 
1000 milliseconds.

Important:
Use these parameters cautiously, as forcefully disabling the package 
can result in data loss. Software AG recommends setting a wait time 
of 30 seconds to allow the shutdown services to complete gracefully.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to 
these parameters to take effect.

Java classes because the classes are not part of the Integration Server
whitelist classes file. The server log contains multiple decode errors for
Integration Server such as: 

BinCoder decode error creating Java serialized object.
Excpt:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: <class_name>, not in White List 

This issue is resolved. 

PIE-82407 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
The pub.security:decrypt public service throws "The service could not retrieve 
the secret key. The secretKey parameter is invalid." 

The pub.security:decrypt service fails to decrypt data if the data is encrypted 
using external tools like PGP or Fusion keys. 

The issue is now resolved.

PIE-82670 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Integration Server excludes empty document fields in REST responses.

Consider a provider REST API Descriptor (RAD) created using an 
OpenAPI document. When a client sends a request to the API, the 
provider service returns a field, which is an empty document. 
However, Integration Server excludes the field in the response
sent to the client.

This issue is resolved. Now, the empty document field is present
in the response as an empty body. For example, "field1" : {}

PIE-82732 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Integration Server throws DataStoreException while processing a JSON 
request. 

After upgrading the Jackson libraries, Integration Server fails to process JSON
strings that exceed 1,000,000 characters in length because of the maximum length
limit of the upgraded libraries. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the  
watt.server.json.decode.maxStringLength parameter to override the limit on 
maximum string length. The default value is 20,00,000. You must restart 
Integration Server for changes to this parameter to take effect.

PIE-82764 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
The "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID" service causes 
performance degradation in Integration Server while deleting large
data sets from MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

To resolve this issue, add the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit
server configuration parameter in Integration Server Administrator
> Settings > Extended > Edit Extended Settings. If the
watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit value is zero, 
Integration Server disables the batching logic. The default value is zero.
You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this
parameter to take effect.

Changes to webMethods Metering for hybrid integration.

The webMethods Metering Agent considers execution of top-level user-defined

in which webMethods Cloud invokes a service residing on an on-premise
Integration Server does not count as a metered transaction despite it being a
top-level service invocation. 

PIE-82939 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Incorrect inactiveCount flag in the log messages of webMethods messaging
triggers. 

In the log messages of webMethods messaging triggers, there is an 
"inactiveCount" flag that indicates the number of times the trigger's poll for 
a message is inactive. However, Integration Server does not reset the 
flag when the trigger successfully processes a new message. As a result, the
inactiveCount keeps incrementing, suggesting a high count for the flag. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server resets the flag to zero when 
webMethods messaging trigger receives a message for processing.

PIE-83129 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
After applying a fix that contains PIE-72571, Enterprise Gateway requests fail
intermittently due to a timeout error. 

After applying a fix that contains PIE-72571, Enterprise Gateway closes all the
internal connections except one which is incorrect. Consequently, when a number
of concurrent requests arrive, several requests timeout and subsequently fail
while waiting for an internal connection. 

This issue is now resolved. Enterprise Gateway maintains internal connections
properly.

Updated jar files for Spring Boot Actuator.

The jar files for spring-boot-actuator have been updated to version 2.7.12.

The previous versions were as follows:

- 10.15: 2.3.11
- 10.11: 2.3.11
- 10.7: 2.3.0
- 10.5: 2.3.0

Upgrading to version 2.7.12 resolves the following vulnerability:

CVE-2023-20883 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20883)

PIE-83387 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
A value placed in cache by a pub.cache* service cannot be retrieved with the key
if a com.wm.data.IData object was used as the key. 
 
If an IData object was used as the key when placing a value in cache using a
pub.cache* service, later attempts to retrieve the value using the same key
might fail. This occurs because IData objects are mutable. 
 
To address this issue, Integration Server now includes the server configuration
parameter watt.server.cache.iDataKey.toString  that specifies whether a
com.wm.data.IData object used as a key in one of the pub.cache* services is
converted to an immutable String before accessing the cache. Set to true to
convert an IData object used as a key to a String. Set to false to keep the key
as an IData object. The default is true. 
 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
Important! If the IData object is modified after it has been used as a key,
Integration Server will not be able to retrieve values stored with the key
regardless of the value of watt.server.cache.iDataKey.toString. 
 
Software AG does not recommend using an IData object as a key with a cache as
IData objects are mutable. Instead, use a java.lang.String object as a key.

PIE-83502 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Integration Server does not write an exception to the error log when a JMS
trigger fails to start. 

When a JMS trigger fails to start at the time Integration Server starts up or
when a disabled trigger is subsequently enabled, Integration Server writes an
error to the server log only. 

Now, when a JMS trigger does not start, Integration Server writes an exception,
which includes a stack trace and other information useful for debugging, to the
server log and the error log. 

PIE-83521 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix12)
Integration Server is indefinitely slow while decoding a document from Universal

Statistics Data Collector incorrectly excludes some statistics for REST APIs.

When the Exclude system services check box is selected on the APIs page of the
Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator, the REST API metrics incorrectly
excludes data from automatically generated services. The Exclude system services
check box was intended to exclude metrics data produced by a service in Wm*
system package. However, the Statistics Data Collector treats services generated
automatically when creating assets in Designer as system services. 

To address this issue, the Statistics Data Collector no longer excludes services
from its metrics gathering for REST APIs. 

Note: This is the server side change for DTS-2588 which removes the Exclude
system services check box.

Integration Server uses the graphql-java-9.4.0.jar library, which has the
CVE-2022-37734 vulnerability. For details about the vulnerability, see
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37734 

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server uses "graphql-java-17.5.0.jar" 
to address the vulnerability. 

Important: The updated JAR requires significant modifications to the schema 
definitions that were created based on previous versions of the JAR. The 
updated JAR imposes several constraints that affect your schema definitions. 
For example:

Implementing multiple interfaces requires using "&" as a separator instead of a 
comma. 
Two interfaces cannot have a common field name.
Defining a new field by extending a type, interface, or input type is not
permitted. 
Extended scalar types such as Long, Short, Char, BigDecimal, BigInteger are not
implicitly supported. 
Depending on the impact of the updated JAR on your current implementation, you
may need to recreate existing assets or redefine the schema. Given that the 
updated JAR introduces breaking changes, it is strongly recommended that you 
contact Software AG support for assistance with your GraphQL workflows.

PIE-79139 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
Integration Server does not remove expired OAuth tokens from the database or
cache properly, resulting in a NullPointerException. 
 
To ensure that expired OAuth tokens are properly removed from the database and
evicted from cache, Integration Server now uses a system task to check for and
remove expired OAuth tokens. The frequency with which Integration Server runs
the system task named Expired OAuth Token Cleanup and the number of expired
tokens that the task removes is determined by the
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.interval and
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.maxRows server configuration parameters,
respectively. 
 
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.interval
Specifies the frequency, measured in minutes, with which the Expired OAuth Token
Cleanup system task runs and removes expired OAuth tokens from the cache and
database. The default is 60. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 
 
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.maxRows
Specifies the maximum number of rows (expired tokens) removed from cache and
database when the Expired OAuth Token Cleanup system task runs. The default is
100. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

To improve troubleshooting, this fix also adds more logging at Trace level for
the server log facility 0010 OAuth. 

PIE-79530 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
Integration Server does not allow the user to provide a filename in the

PIE-79729 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
Changes in how Integration Server handles the expiration of cached OAuth tokens
and the removal of expired OAuth tokens from the database. 

Prior to this fix, the removal of an expired OAuth token from the database was
linked to the expiration of cached OAuth tokens. Now, Integration Server handles
these two activities separately. 

Expiration and removal of expired OAuth tokens from cache

The elements in the OAuthTokens cache and the OAuthAccessTokens cache have a
time-to-live. When the time-to-live elapses, Ehcache evicts the elements.
However, Ehcache does not usually remove the elements from the cache as soon as
they expire. Instead, Ehcache removes expired elements when it needs to make
room for new elements. Previously, Integration Server explicitly removed expired
access tokens from the token cache. Now, Integration Server relies on Ehcache to
remove expired elements. 

Removing expired OAuth tokens from the database

Prior to this fix, Integration Server listened for notifications about expired
OAuth access tokens from Ehcache. In response to a notification, Integration
Server deleted the access token from the database. Now, Integration Server no
longer listens for these notifications. When an OAuth token expires in Ehcache,
Integration Server does not delete the token from the database. Instead,
Integration Server uses the scheduled system task Expired OAuth Token Cleanup to
remove expired tokens. This system task, which is added to Integration Server to
resolve PIE-79139, executes the pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens service at a
regular interval. See the description of PIE-79139 for details on how to control
the frequency and behavior of the Expired OAuth Token Cleanup scheduled system
task. 

In addition to the above changes, the process Integration Server uses to delete
expired tokens form a database has changed. The
pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens service deletes expired access tokens from
the database by performing a series of delete operations in the database.
Previously, the pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens service used a single SQL
statement that involved multiple database tables. If the database contains a
very large number of expired access tokens, the token deletion can take several
minutes, tying up database resources and impacting system performance. Now,
Integration Server deletes the expired tokens in batches. The size of the
batches defaults to 1000. Use the new server configuration property
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.batchSize to change the batch size. A change to
the value of watt.server.oauth.token.removal.batchSize takes effect the next
time pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens executes. Integration Server does not
need to be restarted for changes to this parameter to take effect. 

Note: Take care when making the batch size much larger than the default of 1000.
As each row is deleted, the database will create a row-level lock. A database
may choose to escalate multiple row-level locks to a single table-level lock if
it determines that an operation is creating too many locks. A large batch size
can influence a database to escalate row-level locks. This can increase the
chance of a deadlock in the database. 

As a result of the changes introduced in this fix, the
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity configuration parameter, which was
added for PIE-71548, is now obsolete. This parameter limited the queue size for
notifications about expired OAuth access token. Integration Server no longer
links removal of expired tokens from the database to notifications for expired
access tokens, making a queue for notifications about expired tokens
unnecessary. Integration Server ignores the
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity parameter.

When executing a service from a browser or a DSP page, Integration Server logs 
the following SSL authentication error in the server log:
javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated.

This issue is caused by changes made to internal files for PIE-72765. 
However, the log message is not correct.

PIE-75416 addressed a vulnerability to a session fixation attack. However, the
resolution did not address users authenticated via an Open ID provider.
Additionally, the resolution broke SSO for the same category of users. 

Now, after users are successfully authenticated via an Open ID provider and
successfully log in to Integration Server, Integration Server generates and uses
a new session ID. Additionally, SSO now works for these users.

Administrator, the service execution fails with "java.lang.StackOverflowError". 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81276 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
If the SFTP client in Integration Server implements OpenSSH 8 or later, 
clicking "Get Host Key" in an SFTP server alias returns the host key with ecdsa-
sha2-nistp256 as the prefix. However, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 is not part of the 
prefixes validated by Integration Server. Hence, Integration Server throws 
corrupt or unknown public key format error.

This issue is now resolved by including ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 in the list of 
prefixes validated by Integration Server.

PIE-81394 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
The REST API responses from Integration Server are not completely
HTML-encoded.

Invoking a REST API with the "Accept: application/xml" header returns invalid 
XML responses because Integration Server fails to return HTML entities for 
the pre-defined character entities in XML, such as <, >, &, and so on in 
the response data.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81575 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
Repository-based package deployments result in wrong ACL configurations 
on the target Integration Server.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81648 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
Server log contains the incorrect message "Missing variable restartHours in
monitor.cnf file." 

The Statistics Data Collector in Integration Server provides a default value for
the restartHours property, making the following server log message incorrect:
Missing variable restartHours in monitor.cnf file. 

Integration Server no longer logs the incorrect message.

PIE-81694 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
Integration Server logs the "Unable to create an SMTP client instance for a 
hybrid connectivity alert: The email properties are not configured." error when 
an account or tenant connection is disconnected or restored. 

Integration Server uses the email notification settings configured in 
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Resources to send the hybrid 
connectivity alert mails to the user. If the email notification settings are 
not configured, and the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications 
server configuration parameter has a value other than 'alert' or 'none', 
Integration Server logs the error when an account or tenant connection is 
disconnected or restored. 

This issue is now resolved. Now, the default value of 
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications server configuration 
parameter is 'alert'.

PIE-82061 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix10)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-77728,  executing the pub.io:reset 
service results in the "java.io.IOException: Stream closed" error.

The resolution for PIE-77728 changed the pub.io:streamToString service to close 
the input stream. Consequently, if the pub.io:reset service uses the same
inputStream used by pub.io:streamToString, the pub.io:reset service fails 
because the stream is already closed. The pub.io:reset service ends with the
error: java.io.IOException: Stream closed.

To resolve this issue, the pub.io:streamToString service no longer closes the 
inputStream. Invoke pub.io:close to close the input stream.

PIE-75952 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
Unexpected runtime pipeline if a try-catch construct executes an Exit step
configured to exit $flow and signal failure. 

When using the Try flow step or Sequence step to handle errors, an unexpected
pipeline state occurs when a Loop step is used. Specifically, the pipeline
contains the Loop input array as a scalar variable instead of the original array
when the following series of events occurs: 

- The Try or Sequence step invokes a flow step that contains a child Loop step
- The child Loop step contains an Exit step configured to exit from the $flow
and signal failure 
- The Exit step executes at runtime

In the case of a Sequence step or Try step that invokes a flow step containing
the described Loop step, if the child Loop step exits and signals failure, the
pipeline captured by the pub.flow:getLastError service contains the state of the
pipeline in the middle of Loop step execution. The service returns the input
array as a scalar variable rather than the original array. This is a change from
the behavior available in Integration Server versions prior to 10.3, which
returned the original array with the pub.flow:getLastError service. 

In addition to the scenario described above, the Try step exhibits a similar
pipeline corruption issue when the following series of events occurs: 

- The Try step contains a flow step that invokes child Loop step
- The Loop step is configured to exit $flow and signal failure
- The Try step fails at runtime

The resulting pipeline contains a scalar variable instead of the array variable
used for the input array of the Loop step. The pipeline should contain an array
variable for the Loop input array. 
 
With this fix, the dimension of the Loop input array parameter will not change
after the Loop step exits and signals failure. 

PIE-77771 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
Integration Server throws the following error while connecting to an SFTP 
server: "com.wm.app.b2b.server.sftp.client.SFTPClientException: 
com.sshtools.publickey.InvalidPassphraseException: 
com.maverick.ssh.SshIOException". 

Consider that Integration Server uses the newer SFTP client (version 2) and the 
ED25519 type SSH key pair to connect to an SFTP server. The connection fails 
with SFTPClientException as the maverick-client-1.7.23.jar used by the SFTP 
client lacks support for the ED25519 key signature and SFTP servers that 
support crypto policy. 

This issue is resolved. Applying the fix upgrades the maverick-client-
1.7.23.jar to 1.7.34, which supports the ED25519 key signature. However, the 
upgraded SFTP client does not support authentication keys in the SSH2 format. 
Additionally, the hmac-sha256, hmac-sha256@ssh.com, hmac-sha512, hmac-
sha512@ssh.com, hmac-ripemd160, hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com, hmac-ripemd160-
etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms are not supported. Therefore, for an existing 
server alias, exclude the unsupported MAC algorithms, fetch the host key, and 
save the changes. 

The newer SFTP client (version 2) supports OpenSSH format host keys, and the 
existing key may be in the unsupported SSH2 format. Therefore, testing the 
server alias may throw an error. To avoid the error, regenerate the host key in 
the OpenSSH format, and use the "Get Host Key" button to get the regenerated 
key for the server alias. Similarly, fetch the latest host key if you are 
migrating from an older version of Integration Server, or updating a server 
alias in Integration Server Administrator. 

Once the server alias is successfully created or updated, test whether the user 
alias works with the host key. If testing the user alias results in 
java.security.NoSuchProviderException, add the 
org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider security provider class in 
Integration Server Administrator > Security > Keystore > Add Security Provider.

PIE-79054 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
Integration Server fails to create a payload of the

When you run a connector service from an OpenAPI consumer REST 
API Descriptor, Integration Server fails to create a payload of the
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" media type, as the media type is
unsupported. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server supports the 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" media type.

PIE-79243 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
An OpenAPI multipart request to Integration Server for file upload fails.

In an OpenAPI multipart request to Integration Server, if the payload contains

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-80101 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
A delay in Integration Server startup when Integration Server uses 
LDAP. 

When Integration Server uses an LDAP server, Integration Server queries the 
LDAP server at startup with exhaustive filters for group and user, resulting in 
a delay. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides new server 
configuration parameters to set the object class for user and group filters, 
when querying an LDAP server. Each LDAP server has a different object class for 
defining the user and group filter. For example, the user filter for Active
Directory is "objectclass=user". The user filter for Oracle Directory Server 
is "objectclass=person". 

Server configuration parameters: 

watt.server.ldap.groupObjectClass - Specifies the LDAP object class for the 
group filter. The default value is "group". The other allowed values are 
"groupofnames" and "groupofuniquenames". 

watt.server.ldap.userObjectClass - Specifies the LDAP object class for the 
user filter. The default value is "user".  The other allowed values are 
"person", "inetOrgPerson", and  "organizationalPerson". 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to 
take effect.

PIE-80110 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)

PIE-80315 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
Integration Server now includes protobuf-java_3.19.6.jar which addresses
security-related vulnerabilities existing in earlier versions of the jar file. 

The following security vulnerability has been reported against

configuration parameter. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-80742 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
When creating a JSON document type from a JSON schema with cyclic dependencies,

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server supports creating a JSON 
document type from a JSON schema with cyclic dependencies.

PIE-80891 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
Change to allow access to OAuth configuration pages from Integration Server
Administrator when an Enterprise Gateway port is enabled on the server. 

The Security > OAuth menu and related pages are not available in Integration
Server Administrator when an Enterprise Gateway port is enabled. This is because
an Enterprise Gateway port is usually used on an Integration Server outside the
corporate firewall. OAuth requires a database, which should not be placed
outside the firewall. However, some companies use Enterprise Gateway inside
their firewall, where it is safe to set up a database and perform OAuth
configuration. 

To allow access to OAuth configuration from Integration Server Administrator,
even when an Enterprise Gateway port is enabled, set the new sever configuration
parameter watt.server.oauth.alwaysAvailable to true. A complete description of
the parameter follows. 

watt.server.oauth.alwaysAvailable
Specifies whether OAuth configuration is available on Integration Server
Administrator even when an Enterprise Gateway port is enabled on the server. Set
to true for the Security > OAuth menu item and related pages to be visible in
Integration Server Administrator, even if an Enterprise Gateway port is enabled
on the server. When set to false, the Security > OAuth menu and related pages
will be visible in Integration Server Administrator only if an Enterprise
Gateway port is not enabled on the server. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

Note:  Browsers often cache web page elements. Users may need to clear the
browser cache to see the effect of changing watt.server.oauth.alwaysAvailable. 

Important! The watt.server.oauth.alwaysAvailable parameter should be set to true
only when Integration Server is inside the corporate firewall. This is because
OAuth requires a database, which should not be placed outside the firewall.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81070 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
Integration Server throws an invalid input error when the optional
elements are excluded from an OpenAPI request payload.

If the optional elements defined in the Swagger document are excluded from an

issue occurs in some scenarios involving oneOf, anyOf, or allOf schemas.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81171 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix9)
Integration Server now provides alerts for hybrid connectivity.

A new channel, "Hybrid Connections" is added for hybrid connectivity alerts,
which are generated for the following events:

- Tenant connection disconnected
- Tenant connection restored
- Account disconnected
- Account restored

When an account connection or a tenant connection is disconnected or restored,
Integration Server notifies the user through a notification in Integration
Server Administrator followed by an email.
You can configure the hybrid connectivity notifications using
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications server configuration
parameter and the recipients of the notification emails using 
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail server configuration parameter.

Integration Server uses the email notification settings configured in 
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Resources.

Note: If the email notification settings are not configured, then change the
value of watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications to "alert" to avoid 
SMTP errors in the log.

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail
Specifies the list of email addresses to which Integration Server sends emails
about errors and warnings related to the connection status between Integration
Server and webMethods Cloud. Use a semicolon (;) as a delimiter to specify
multiple email addresses. By default, the parameter value is blank.

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications
Specifies whether Integration Server generates notifications and notifies users
when a tenant connection or an account for webMethods Cloud is disconnected or
restored. The parameter can have one of the following values:

- alert: Integration Server displays a notification in Integration Server
Administrator.
- email: Integration Server sends an email to the user.
- none: Integration Server does not notify the user.

Note: If you are using any value other than alert, email, or none, Integration 
Server notifies the user through a notification in Integration Server 
Administrator, followed by an email. By default, the parameter value is alert.
 
Integration Server restart is not required for changes to these parameters to 
take effect.

In addition, the HybridConnections health indicator is added to track the status
of hybrid connections.
HybridConnections: Checks all the listed tenant connection
aliases and associated accounts for webMethods Cloud. Returns a status of UP if
all of the listed tenant connections and associated accounts are UP.
Returns a status of DOWN if any of the listed tenant or account connections are
down. The health indicator includes individual statuses for tenant connections
and associated accounts, along with the overall hybrid connection status.
If an enabled tenant connection does not have an account alias or the account
alias is not enabled, the health indicator does not list the tenant alias.
If a tenant connection is disabled and the associated account is enabled, the
health indicator shows the account status.

An ICAP client does not honor the Preview header sent in the ICAP OPTIONS 
response and requires a Transfer-* header. 

RFC (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3507.html#section-4.5) does not mention 
that the Preview header must have a Transfer-*. To affect a Preview, an ICAP 
client must add a "Preview:" header to its request headers defining the length 
of the preview. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76010 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server ICAP client does not honor the ICAP specification to 
mandatorily encapsulate the whole HTTP request before sending it to the ICAP 
server. Additionally, for a text message that is not a virus, the HTTP status 
code is empty even if the ICAP status is 'ICAP/1.0 200 OK'. Hence, Integration 
Server treats a non-malicious text message as a virus after encapsulating the 
whole HTTP request. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76115 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server throws "425 Unable to build data connection: TLS session of

Hence, the pub.client.ftp:ls service fails to build a data connection. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76249 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server sends an invalid SOAP response to the client while returning

incorrect. The response from Integration Server must contain a single envelope 
with the error. 

This issue is resolved.

PIE-76978 and PIE-79166 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server logs the error message Unable to save event in table.

When the Integration Server is running a very high transaction rate, it is
possible for the following error message to appear: 
 
[ISS.0045.0038E] (tid=<threadID>) Unable to save event in table. Details: null. 
 
When this error occurs, a portion of the statistics data for that 60 second time
interval is lost. 
 
This issue is now resolved. The aforementioned error no longer occurs,
preventing the loss of statistics data.

PIE-78417 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
After applying a fix that included PIE-72514, deployment sometimes fails with an
exception about deletion of artifacts. 

The solution for PIE-72514 introduced new logic for copying Deployer artifacts
into an Integration Sever installation. However, some of the streams used for
file copy operations were not properly closed, resulting in failed deployments
and an exception like the following: 

Exception: [ISS.0088.9112] An Exception was thrown in the server:[ISS.0085.9345]
Deletion of artifacts delivered for deployment ID <deployment_ID> failed with an
exception. For more information, see the Integration Server logs. 

This issue now fixed. Streams for file copy operations are now properly closed.

PIE-78564 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
A request to log into Integration Server via the Integration Server
Administrator API results in a response with an extra Set-Cookie headers. 

The response to a log in request sent via the Integration Server Administrator
API contains two Set-Cookie headers. One Set-Cookie header holds a null ssnid
attribute. The other Set-Cookie header contains the ssnid attribute set to the
actual session ID. 

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server no longer includes the Set-Cookie
header with a null ssnid in the response to a login request. 

PIE-78569 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Using Integration Server to create a URL alias that contains the reserved
directive wm-message can prevent Designer from connecting to Integration Server. 
 
A URL alias cannot contain a directive reserved for use by Integration Server
such as invoke, wm-message, admin, or rest. Designer might not be able to
connect to Integration Server if a URL alias contains a reserved directive. 
 
Integration Server now performs validation checks that prevent the creation of a
URL alias that uses the reserved directive wm-message. Additionally, Integration
Server provides more logging for the server log and security log when creating
or editing URL aliases. 

PIE-78654 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Multiple sessions on Integration Server are established for a user login, which
can result in an invalid session count. 

For each user log in to Integration Server Integration Server or Integration
Server Administrator, one session is established for accessing the log in page
(this session has a user ID of local/default) and another is established when
user is authenticated (this session has a user ID of local/Administrator).
However, the initial session is not killed when the second session is
established. This results in an invalid session count. Additionally, the initial
session for the local/default users consumes a licensed session. 

Now, once the user is authenticated, Integration Server kills the initial
session for the local/default user that was created when the Integration Server
log in page was accessed. 

PIE-78672 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server logs custom fault messages returned by a provider service
in the error log.

When a provider service returns the custom fault messages, Integration Server
logs such custom fault messages in the error log file.

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server introduces the 
watt.server.soap.suppressFaultAsError server configuration parameter that helps 
control whether custom fault messages are logged or not.
 
watt.server.soap.suppressFaultAsError - Set to true to prevent Integration 
Server from logging the custom fault messages in the error log. Set to false to 
log custom fault messages as errors. The default value is false.
 
If you update the parameter value, you need not restart Integration Server for 
the changes to take effect.
 
Note: Although Integration Server suppresses custom log messages when the 
parameter is true, the service error count on the Statistics page in 
Integration Server Administrator includes the custom fault messages.

PIE-78721 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
The pub.json:documentToJSONString service incorrectly converts a 
date object using the local time zone. 

While converting a date object with 'encodeDateAs' set to 'ISO8601', 
the pub.json:documentToJSONString service considers the local time 
zone instead of the Zulu time zone or UTC, resulting in a time difference. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78746 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server incorrectly displays Unicode characters in the

The server logger resets to the default INFO logging level after 
Integration Server restart.

If you set the logging level for server logger using Integration Server

changes to the default INFO level after a restart. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-79159 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server fails to get a connection from the JDBC connection pool 
after editing the pool alias. 

When the Spy Diagnostics feature is enabled and the database URL uses an 
SQLServer URL with instanceName instead of the port, editing the JDBC
connection pool alias from Integration Server Administrator adds a space to 
the spyParms attribute in the pool configuration file (alias.xml). As a result, 
Integration Server fails to get a connection from the connection pool. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-79161 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
OpenAPI requests to Integration Server with empty objects fail.

Consider a provider REST API Descriptor (RAD) created from an OpenAPI document
with an object defined in the schema without properties. Integration Server
fails to process the OpenAPI requests with such objects. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-79205 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server throws "java.lang.NumberFormatException" while 
creating a Rest API Descriptor (RAD) from a REST resource that 
references a service signature with date or time variables 
having minimum and maximum values. 

Swagger specification does not support minimum and maximum values 
for date and time variables. Hence, Integration Server fails to 
create a RAD based on Swagger specification and a REST resource 
that references a service signature with date or time variables 
having minimum and maximum values. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server ignores the minimum 
and maximum values for date and time variables while creating the RAD. 

Note: If Integration Server and Designer are installed in different 
directories, run Update Manager to install the Integration Server client 
fix in the directory where Designer is installed.

PIE-79219 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
User session data is lost while invoking a REST connector service. 

When you invoke a REST connector service generated from a Swagger

use the data from the current session, resulting in data loss. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server does not create a new session 
but retains the data from the current session while executing the REST 
connector service.

PIE-79261 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server does not log the actual cause for denying an incoming 
payload for SQL injection rule violation. 

The issue is resolved. Now, the log message shows the cause for denying an 
incoming payload for SQL injection rule violation. For example, instead of 
"Possible SQL injection threat for Oracle database.", Integration Server now 
logs "Possible SQL injection threat for Oracle database. The incoming payload 
for the requested URL contains an invalid character."

PIE-79347 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server does not start after applying a fix that includes PIE-76261. 
 
A conflict between old SAML libraries and the upgraded ESAPI 2.4.0.0 libraries
included with PIE-76261 resulted in incompatible classes being used for ESAPI
security configuration. 
 
This issue has been resolved by setting the security configuration to a
compatible class. 

PIE-79351 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
As part of this fix, Integration Server supports OAuth based authentication for 
email notifications.

Procedure

1. Log on to Integration Server Administrator.
2. Go to Settings > Resources.
3. Click Edit Resource Settings and enter the following details to configure  
   OAuth based authentication for email notifications. 

    - Username - Type the e-mail address of the account that Integration Server uses
      to connect to the SMTP server.
    - Authentication - Specify the type of authentication that Integration Server should
      use to connect to the specified e-mail server. 
        - Select Basic Authentication if you want to authenticate the user on the 
        specified e-mail server with only login credentials (username and password).
        - Select OAuth to authenticate the user on the specified e-mail server using
        the credentials issued by the OAuth server.
        Note: Only the Authorization Code grant type is supported for OAuth.
              To obtain the OAuth credentials for Integration Server, you must first
              register Integration Server with the OAuth Server. For details about
              registering an application and obtaining the OAuth credentials, see 
              your authorization server's documentation.
    - Password - Type the password associated with the username that identifies you
      on the SMTP server. This field applies only to Basic Authentication.
    - Auth URL - Specify the URL of the email provider or endpoint that Integration
    Server uses to request authorization code. This field applies only to OAuth.
    - Client ID - Specify the unique public identifier that the OAuth server 
    generates for Integration Server during registration. This field applies only to 
    OAuth.
    - Client Secret - Specify a unique string that the OAuth server provides to 
    Integration Server. It is known only to Integration Server and the authorization
    server. This field applies only to OAuth.
    - Scope - Specify the mail server access permissions configured for Integration 
    Server during registration. You can specify multiple scopes separated by a space.
    This field applies only to OAuth.
    - Access Token URL - Specify the URL that Integration Server must use to request
    an access token from the OAuth server. This field applies only to OAuth.
    - Redirect URL - Specify the URL that the OAuth server uses to send authentication
    responses to Integration Server. This field applies only to OAuth.
        - If you access Integration Server locally, enter the redirect URL in one of 
          the applicable formats:
        "http://localhost:{port}/WmRoot/security-oauth-get-authcode.dsp"
        "https://localhost:{port}/WmRoot/security-oauth-get-authcode.dsp"
         - If you access Integration Server remotely, use 
                    "https://{ISHostName}:{port}/WmRoot/security-oauth-get-authcode.dsp"
    - Get Authorization Code - Click Get Authorization Code to receive a unique string
    from the OAuth Server that Integration Server requires to request an access 
    token. A new window prompts for user credentials. After a successful login, an 
    authorization code is sent to the redirect URL.
    Alternatively, you can obtain the authorization code manually in scenarios that
    do not allow you to obtain the authorization code through Integration Server 
    Administrator.
    To obtain the authorization code manually, send a request through a browser in 
    the format:
    <URL of an emailprovider>/<TenantID>/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&prompt=login&
    redirect_uri="http://host:port/WmRoot/securityoauth-get-authcode.dsp&client_id=
    <clientID>&scope=<scope>"
    Here, response_type is set to code to inform the OAuth server that Integration 
    Server expects an authorization code as the response at the mentioned 
    redirect_uri.
    Note: Since the code generated is valid only for one-time usage, get the 
    authorization code each time you update the OAuth relevant fields.
    - Access Token Expiry Time - This field is displayed specifying the time until 
    when an access token issued to Integration Server is valid. This field applies 
    only to OAuth. This is a read-only field displayed based on the access token.
    - Token Refresh Interval - Specifies the time interval in minutes at which 
    the cron job is scheduled to fetch a new access token. The access token and the 
    refresh token are issued the first time you save the settings for email 
    notifications. Thereafter, the scheduled cron job refreshes and fetches the 
    access token using the refresh token, ensuring that a valid access token is used 
    to send mails. The default is 15 minutes.
    Note: If the access token expires, the user needs to give consent again using 
    login credentials and regenerate the tokens by editing the Email Notification 
    Settings.
    Click Save Changes to update the server with the new or changed email 
    notification settings. Your changes take effect immediately, and you start 
    receiving emails in case of any errors. In addition, the Access Token Expiry Time 
    is displayed.

Alternatively, you can set all the email notification parameters using the 
following new server configuration parameters.
You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to these parameters to
take effect.

    - watt.server.smtp.authentication.type - Specifies the type of authentication 
      that Integration Server should use to connect to the specified e-mail server.
      Select Basic Authentication or OAuth.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.accessTokenURL - Specifies the URL that Integration 
      Server must use to request an access token from the OAuth server.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.authorizationCode - Specifies the authorization code 
      used to get an access token manually in scenarios where browser support is 
      unavailable.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.authURL - Specifies the URL of the email provider or 
      endpoint that Integration Server uses to request authorization code.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.clientID - Specifies the unique public identifier the 
      OAuth server generates for Integration Server during registration.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.clientSecret - Specifies a unique string that the OAuth 
      server provides to Integration Server while registering Integration Server as 
      an application. It is known only to Integration Server and the authorization 
      server.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.redirectURL - Specifies the URL that the OAuth server
      uses to send authentication responses to Integration Server.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.token.refreshInterval - Specifies the time interval in 
      minutes the cron job is scheduled to fetch a new access token. The default is
      15 minutes to fetch a new access token by using the refresh token and setting
      it for email notification settings.
    - watt.server.smtp.oauth.scope - Specifies the mail server access permissions
      configured for Integration Server during registration. You can specify multiple 
      scopes separated by a space.

PIE-79408 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
When applying a configuration variables template, Microservices Runtime ignores
the value of the messaging.<connectionAliasName>.default property and instead
sets any alias for which the property is specified as the default alias. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-79489 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-75533, calls to an endpoint may take 
upto 10 seconds longer as the changes due to the fix invoke the 
socket.getInetAddress().getHostName() method. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server calls the
socket.getRemoteAddress() method instead of the socket.getInetAddress() 
.getHostName() method.

PIE-79512 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server generates incorrect service signature for multipart 
content-type in an OpenAPI document.

Creating a REST API Descriptor (RAD) from an OpenAPI document 
that contains multipart content-type with a schema reference 
results in an incorrect service signature for the multipart content-type.

This issue is resolved.

PIE-79680 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server creates and deletes the OpenID configuration file for
Salesforce. 

On alternating startups, Integration Server deletes and then creates the
salesforce.com.json configuration file used for OpenID and located at: 

<IntegrationServer>/instances/<instanceName>/config/security/openid/

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server creates the salesforce.com.json
configuration file if it is not present on startup but does not remove it if it
already exists. 

PIE-79682 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Attempts to create a URL alias via the Integration Server Administrator
API fail if the alias name contains a "/" character.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-79758 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Addition of classes to the whitelist classes file for Integration Server.

Integration Server includes a whitelist of the classes that can be loaded and
deserialized in Integration Server. The following classes have been added to the
whitelist maintained by Integration Server: 

java.io.IOException
java.io.StreamCorruptedException
java.net.UnknownHostException
java.io.FileNotFoundException
java.net.ConnectException
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException
wm.cds.integration.ISSessionManager$1
com.wm.net.ftpCException

PIE-79765 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Creating a consumer REST API Descriptor (RAD) from a Swagger document 
generates a connector service that returns an empty response body.

When you create a consumer RAD in Integration Server 
from a Swagger document that has a default response object, Integration
Server does not create a document from the default response object 
schema in the output of the generated connector service. 
Additionally, if you run the connector service, and the output 
has a response code that is not defined as a response object 
in the Swagger document, the response body is empty.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server returns a document 
generated from the default response object schema at runtime.

PIE-79776 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
The watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity server configuration parameter
is not visible on the Extended Settings page and of Integration Server
Administrator. 

The change to address issue PIE-71548, which prevents a potential thread
deadlock scenario in receiving and processing expired access token
notifications, added the new configuration parameter
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity. A description of the configuration
parameter was not included in the fix readme and is not visible on the Extended
Settings page of Integration Server Administrator. 

Now, watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity appears on the Extended
Settings page. A description of the parameter is below: 

watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity
Specifies the maximum capacity of the queue that Integration Server uses to
handle expired access tokens. When the queue reaches capacity, Integration
Server blocks threads attempting to put more access tokens into the queue. This
prevents the queue from growing too large and creating memory pressure when
Integration Server is under very high load. The default value is 10000. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity to take effect. 

PIE-79820 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
The status of service invocation from Designer is unknown as the result is
empty. 

When "watt.server.http.returnException" is set to false, Integration Server 
returns an empty result on the failure of service invocation from Designer.
Hence, users do not know whether the service failed or succeeded. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server returns an error message 
instead of an empty result when a service fails.

PIE-79907 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server rejects an Id Token with an acr value if the
acr_values_supported field is not in an OpenID provider's configuration. 

The acr_values_supported field is not required in an OpenID provider's
configuration. When it is not present and the provider presents an Id Token with
an acr value, Integration Server incorrectly rejects the Id Token with an error
indicating the acr value is invalid. 

This has been resolved. When an OpenID provider's configuration does not include
an acr_values_supported field, the acr field in the provider's Id Token may
contain any string value. 

PIE-80050 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
The "pub.string:substitutePipelineVariables" service does not substitute a 
variable with its value. 

While using the "pub.string:substitutePipelineVariables" service, if the 
'inString' input parameter takes a document array pipeline variable (for 
example, %doc[0]/name%) as the value, the service does not substitute the 
variable with its corresponding value. 

The issue is now resolved.

PIE-80157 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix8)
Responses from Integration server are not completely HTML-encoded. 

Integration Server must return HTML-encoded entities corresponding to all 
characters, including (< > " ' )  in the responses. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72765 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Upgrade the Entrust Toolkit included with Integration Server to version 8.1.20.

Integration Server now uses Entrust Toolkit 8.1.20. This upgrade has the following impacts:

- An Integration Server to which the latest Java fixes were applied no longer
fails at startup due to a java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError. This error 
occurred because the latest Java fixes provided by Software AG did not allow
any jar file signed with the deprecated SHA1 algorithm to be loaded.
Previously, Integration Server used Entrust Toolkit 8.0.33 which was signed with
the SHA1 algorithm. This prevented Integration Server from starting up
successfully if the latest Java fixes were applied.

- JSSE is used for secured inbound and outbound communication. Previously, use
of JSSE for secured inbound and outbound communications was the default, but
optional. If JSSE was not used, the iaik.security.ssl package in the Entrust
IAIK library provided in Entrust Toolkit 8.0.33 was used to establish the
connection. However, Entrust Toolkit 8.1.20, which Integration Server now uses,
no longer supports the iaik.security.ssl package. Use of JSSE is more secure.
In accordance with this change, the Use JSSE options have been removed from
port configuration pages in Integration Server Administrator, useJSSE input 
fields have been removed from built-in services in WmPublic, and server 
configuration parameters related to using Entrust to establish a connection have 
been removed. 

For a detailed list of impacted services, port configurations, and server 
configuration parameters, see below.

Note: If you need Integration Server to use TLSv1 to communicate with a legacy 
server, you need to edit the java.security file used by the JVM. For more 
information about editing the java.security file, refer to the JVM documentation.

Impacted Built-In Services

The following services no longer include a useJSSE input parameter as all outbound 
connections use JSSE. The useJSSE parameter may still appear in the pipeline, 
however, Integration Server ignores the value, proceeding as if useJSSE were set to yes:

- pub.alert.notifier:create The smtpSender/secure/useJSSE input parameter has been removed.
- pub.alert.notifier:update The smtpSender/secure/useJSSE input parameter has been removed.
- pub.alert.notifier:list The smtpSender/secure/useJSSE output parameter has been removed.
- pub.client:http The useJSSE input parameter has been removed.
- pub.client:smtp The useJSSE input parameter has been removed.
- pub.client:soapClient The useJSSE input parameter has been removed.
- pub.client:ftp The secure/useJSSE input parameter has been removed.
- pub.client.ftp:login The secure/useJSSE input parameter has been removed.
 
Removed Server Configuration Parameters

- watt.net.ssl.client.cipherSuiteList
- watt.net.ssl.client.ftps.useJSSE
- watt.net.ssl.client.handshake.maxVersion
- watt.net.ssl.client.handshake.minVersion
- watt.net.ssl.client.strongcipheronly
- watt.net.ssl.client.useJSSE
- watt.net.ssl.email.client.useJSSE
- watt.net.ssl.email.client.smtp.useJSSE
- watt.net.ssl.server.cipherSuiteList
- watt.net.ssl.server.handshake.maxVersion
- watt.net.ssl.server.handshake.minVersion
- watt.net.ssl.server.strongcipheronly

In addition to the removed server configuration parameters above, the existing 
parameter watt.net.socketProvider now has a default value of com.wm.ext.jsse.JSSESecureSocketFactory. 
Prior to this fix, the default value was com.wm.ext.iaik.IaikSecureSocket.

PIE-73638 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
When the connection between Integration Server and the LDAP server is unstable, 
logging in to Integration Server fails intermittently with the "Unable to open 
a connection to ldap" error. 

The issue is resolved.  Now, the com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.timeout and 
com.sun.jndi.ldap.read.timeout properties are set while creating the LDAP 
context, which prevents intermittent connection failures. The default value for 
both properties is 30 seconds. Alternatively, a user can set these properties
through the watt.server.ldap.extendedProps server configuration parameter.

PIE-74414 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
When watt.server.http.returnException is set to webMethods and a SOAP request
results in an error, Integration Server throws a NullPointerException if the
request did not contain a User-Agent header. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74710 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
A GET request for an /alert resource in the Integration Server Administrator
API results in an error message when valid values are supplied for startTime and
endTime in a URL parameter. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-74713 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Update to the Integration Server Administrator API framework to allow other
Software AG products flexibility regarding the placement of ResourceBundles. 

PIE-75844 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server fails to set default values for arrays and complex
objects.

In an OpenAPI request or response, if data is not provided for
a particular object, Integration Server must use the default
values for objects in the OpenAPI document. However, Integration
Server fails to use the default values for arrays or complex objects.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76253 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
JVM statistics are missing from the Dashboard in Integration Server
Administrator. 

Depending on the Java version and fix level, some JVM statistics were missing
from the Dashboard because Integration Server did not collect them. 

Integration Server now collects JVM statistics regardless of JVM version and fix
level, preventing missing JVM statistics in the Dashboard. 

PIE-76622 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server fails to start after applying IS_10.11_Tanuki_Fix1 and 
creating a new instance. 

After creating the new Integration Server instance, the wrapper-is-license.conf 
file present in the wm-is-osgi-profile.jar is copied to the newly created 
instance. The post-installation steps mentioned in the IS_10.11_Tanuki_Fix1 
readme modifies the wrapper.conf file. The wrapper-is-license.conf file copied 
from the wm-is-osgi-profile.jar does not authorize the use of this modified
version of the wrapper.conf file. Hence, Integration Server throws a License Key error. 

The issue is resolved. The updated wrapper-is-license.conf is now moved from 
the wm-is-osgi-profile.jar to <Install_Directory>/IntegrationServer/instances 
and the new instance creation uses this wrapper-is-license.conf file for 
restarting Integration Server. 

PIE-76676 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server does not support OAuth token authentication for POP3 email 
ports. 

Integration Server does not support OAuth token authentication for POP3 email 
ports. Therefore, configuring OAuth for a POP3 email port
results in an error message indicating that OAuth is supported 
for IMAP ports only. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76829 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server does not restart the JMS triggers that fail during
the trigger registration process.

Integration Server does not attempt to restart the triggers that fail 
during the trigger registration process. The failed triggers remain 
disabled unless enabled manually.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server restarts the 
failed triggers that fail during the trigger registration process unless 
the failure is due to configuration issues.

PIE-76895 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
For HTTP requests that return the 401 response code, the pub.client:http 
service sends another request if a cookie header is used for authentication in 
the HTTP request. 

The issue is resolved now. The watt.net.http401.retryWithoutCookie server 
configuration parameter is introduced. Set the parameter to false to prevent 
the pub.client:http service from sending a duplicate request. The default value 
is true, which retains the old behavior. You do not need to restart Integration 
Server for the changes to take effect.

PIE-77042 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Debugging an OpenAPI connector service returns an incorrect response.

While executing a connector service generated from an OpenAPI 
document, the service execution sends the REST request to 
the provider and returns the correct response. However, if 
you run the connector service in the debug mode in Designer, 
the service execution does not send the request to the 
REST provider and returns an incorrect response.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77076 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server returns incorrect output for a mapping service with 
two variables of the same name but different types. 

Consider a flow service with a map step that maps a pipeline input to a variable
of the Document List type. The flow service has another 
variable of the same name but of type Document. In such scenarios, Integration
Server performs an incorrect mapping at runtime, which results in data loss. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77199 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Saving a flow service returns the Java heap space error. 

Consider a new Document Type created from an XML schema. On  
saving a flow service that has a map step with the Document Type, 
Integration Server returns the Java heap space error. However, the 
issue only occurs if the flow service containing the Document Type 
is created and saved before restarting Integration Server. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77209 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server does not start if an unrecognized class is persisted in
eventcfg.bin. 

If an unrecognized class is persisted in eventcfg.bin, Event Manager cannot
deserialize it during initialization. This prevents Integration Server from
starting. 

This is now fixed. When reading the eventcfg.bin, Integration Server logs an
error for each error that it encounters. This allows Integration Server to
proceed with startup. 

PIE-77408 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
The "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID" service causes 
performance degradation in databases while deleting large data sets.

Integration Server uses wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID to 
remove the expired entries from the WM_IDR_MSG_HST table. 
However, in some databases, wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID degrades the
database performance while deleting large data sets. 

This issue is resolved.

Now, Integration server provides an option to remove the expired 
entries in batches and to configure the batch size. To limit the 
batch size, use the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit server
configuration parameter. If you set the parameter value to a 
positive integer, Integration Server uses the value to apply a 
batching logic to remove the entries. If you are not providing 
any value, Integration Server retains the old behavior. There is no 
default value for the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit 
parameter. You do not need to restart Integration Server for 
changes to this parameter to take effect. 

PIE-77819 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
In an Integration Server setup with API Gateway, when NTLM authentication is 
enabled for a native service, Integration Server throws the "Exception during 
NTLM handshake : Socket input is already shutdown" error endlessly if any 
exception occurs during an NTLM handshake. 

The issue is resolved. Now, if there is an NTLM handshake exception, 
Integration Server returns the same exception to the caller.

PIE-78021 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Event Manager subscriptions do not work properly when
watt.server.idatacoder.legacy is set to false. 

The value of the server configuration parameter watt.server.idatacoder.legacy
determines whether Integration Server uses the current version or the legacy
version of the IDataBinCoder for encoding documents using the binary protocol. 
A value of true indicates the legacy version is used; false (the default value)
indicates the new version is used. However, when the parameter is set to false,
using Event Manager to add a subscription for an event type results in the
unwanted replication of the subscription for other event types. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-78037 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
A dateTime string does not pass validation by pub.schema:validate but should.

All valid lexical representations of the XML Schema data type dateTime should
pass XML validation. However, the pub.schema:validate service incorrectly flags
some lexical representations of dateTime as invalid when milliseconds are
included. Specifically, a dateTime value that includes 24:00:00 as the time
fails validation if the seconds fragment included milliseconds. That is, the
pub.schema:validate service treats a time value of 24:00:00 as valid but treats
24:00:00.000 as invalid. This is incorrect. 

Now, all valid datetime representations that include milliseconds will pass
validation. 

PIE-78127 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
When the watt.server.httplog value is changed and the http log file rotates
prior to Integration Server restart, the rotated file is empty. 

This has been resolved. The http log now rotates successfully after the value of
watt.server.httplog is changed. 

PIE-78132 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Introspection requests are sent to an external authorization server fail if the
server log facility 10 OAuth level is Debug or a more verbose level. 

When the server log facility 10 OAuth is set to the Debug level or a more
verbose level, OAuth authorization requests sent to the introspection endpoint
on an external authorization server fail. The failure is due to inadvertent
modification of the password value in the request body when logging for the
OAuth facility is set to the Debug level or a more verbose level. 

This issue has been corrected.

PIE-78156 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-72193, exceptions are missing from the
logs displayed in Designer. 

When Designer is used to invoke the internal service
wm.server.packages:getDependenciesList and an invalid package name is specified,
the Results tab does not display exceptions. 

Now, Designer shows exception details when the internal service
wm.server.packages:getDependenciesList is invoked with an invalid package name. 

PIE-78255 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
The migrate.cnf migration settings file has an error in the record name.

In the migrate.cnf file, the record name has an underscore, which is incorrect.

<record name="IS_CustomWrapperMigrator" javaclass="com.wm.util.Values">
  <value name="isSelected">false</value>
</record>

The issue is resolved. Now, the underscore in the record name is removed.

PIE-78263 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
The Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator does not display metrics data
when Task Engine's TE@IS is used with the HPSTRA feature. 

An incompatibility between the usage of Elasticsearch by TE@IS and the
Statistics Data Collector in Integration Server prevents the display of metrics
on the Dashboard. This incompatibility can be confirmed as the cause when the
following exception appears in the error log: 

<Timestamp> [ISS.0045.9998E] (<thread ID>) Exception --> Exception getting
Lucene Codec: org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene50/Lucene50PostingsFormat,  Cause?
org.apache.lucene.codecs.lucene50.Lucene50PostingsFormat 

This message appears only if the 0045 Statistics Data Collector logging facility
writes message at the Error, Fatal, or more verbose levels. 

This issue is resolved via application of this fix and by editing the
custom_wrapper.conf to disable the entire TE@IS, which disables the HPSTRA
feature as well. 

Important! After applying this fix, you must add or update the following
property in the <Software
AG_directory>/profiles/<IS_instance_name>/configuration/custom_wrapper.conf
file: 

wrapper.java.additional.<availableNumber>=-Dtask.library.mode.enable=false

Then, restart Integration Server.

Note: Setting -Dtask.library.mode.enable=false disables the entire TE@IS
functionality and the HPSTRA feature.  The TE@IS and HPSTRA features must be
disabled in order for the Dashboard to display metrics.

Creating a gRPC provider descriptor from some proto file ends with errors.

Unhandled class path and file path issues cause attempts to create a gRPC

When Integration Server starts up, a critical message and an error message about
indexFileDir appear in the console. 

Integration Server writes the following messages to the console during start up:

[ISS.0045.0045C] (tid=###) Failed to create or append index. Details:
'indexFileDir' must be declared before an index may be opened. 

[ISS.0030.0013E] (tid=###) An exception was encountered while processing an

request failed. Details: [ISS.0045.0045] Failed to create or append index.
Details: 'indexFileDir' must be declared before an index may be opened. 

These messages occur because the Statistics Data Collector, which gathers and
returns metrics for the Dashboard, has not yet completed startup. 

This issue is now resolved. The error message ISS.0030.0013 will no longer
appear during startup. The Critical level message ISS.0045.0045 is now logged at
the Debug level. 

PIE-78321 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
When strict service caching is in use, Integration Server does not merge the
cached results into the pipeline. 

When strict service caching is enabled
(watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict=true), Integration Server should merge
the output values cached for the declared output signature into the calling
service pipeline. However, Integration Server does not merge the cached values
into the pipeline and instead returns only the cached values. 

This issue is now fixed.

Rollback of a message received by a webMethods messaging trigger 
results in excessive logging at the Info level in the server log.

When Integration Server rolls back a message received by a 
webMethods messaging trigger to Universal Messaging, Integration 
Server writes all the rollback details at the Info logging level 
instead of the Debug level.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server writes the log messages 
for rollback of a message when the facility 0153 dispatcher 
(Universal Messaging) is set to Debug or a more verbose level.

PIE-78392 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
Service invoked via com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient fails if
watt.server.http.jsonFormat is set to stream or bytes 

When the server configuration parameter watt.server.http.jsonFormat is set to
stream or bytes, the body of a request sent from
com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient to Integration Server is not parsed into a
pipeline. Invocation of the requested services fails because expected variables
are not present in the input pipeline. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server adds the "User-agent: webMethods"
header to each request sent from com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient. The header
instructs Integration Server to parse the JSON, regardless of the
watt.server.http.jsonFormat setting.

The pub.client.ftp:login service throws a NullPointerException while using the
FTPS protocol in the implicit mode. 

Implicit FTPS is deprecated and Integration Server does not support the FTPS

NullPointerException. 

The issue is now resolved. The NullPointerException is now replaced with the
"Implicit FTPS is not supported." message.

webMethods products can use their own package ClassLoaders to expose an API
though the Integration Server Administrator API framework. When this happens,
wmisa (the command line administrator tool) cannot retrieve online help for the
product. 

This fix changes the Integration Server Administrator API framework so that
online help for all webMethods administrator APIs can be viewed with the command
line tool. 

Note that wmisa, the command line client for administering Integration Server,
is an unsupported utility that can be installed from

- ISAdmin -> updateFunctionalAlias - refreshedFailFastMode on function
ISDashboardStats to false 
- Failed to create or append index. Details: 'indexFileDir' must be declared

After the Statistics Data Collector completes startup, the messages no longer
appear and the Dashboard is updated as expected. 

In addition to resolution of the above issue, facility 45 Statistics Data
Collector no longer produces Critical level messages because statistics data
collection is not critical to the function of Integration Server. Instead, these
messages are logged at the error level. 

PIE-78758 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix7)
When Integration Server writes log messages to the console, the console contains

Now, if password change is required upon initial log in, Integration Server does
not accept the old password as the new value. Instead, Integration Server
displays the following error message, and the user must provide a new password: 

"Administrator password must be changed from default value provided during

PIE-74175 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
Integration Server returns an empty response body for REST requests. 

In older implementations, Integration Server returns the response body for 
REST requests even if the targeted service returns undefined data. However, 
Integration Server now returns a response with a populated response body
only if the response body is defined in the imported Swagger document.
As a result, REST clients receive an empty response body if the
targeted service returns undefined data. 

This issue is now resolved by introducing a workaround using 
the watt.server.rest.honorLegacyStructure server configuration parameter.
By default, the parameter is set to 'false', which disables the workaround.
Set the value to 'true' to enable the workaround. This workaround supports
older implementations that rely on returning undefined data in the
response and applies to REST API Descriptors (RAD) created or refreshed
earlier to this fix. You do not need to restart Integration Server for the
changes to take effect.

PIE-74746 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
After migrating to an Integration Server to which a fix containing PIE-67747 has
been applied, the password of a cloned live database configured for a JDBC
connection pool alias is incorrect. 
 
When migrating an Integration Server instance, users can choose to use a clone
of the live database for the JDBC connection pool alias associated with a JDBC
functional alias. If two or more JDBC connection pool aliases exist, the
migration utility prompts for the password for one JDBC connection pool alias
but not for any of the other JDBC pool aliases. As a result, the migrate.dat
file prepared by the migration utility does not contain the password for the
JDBC connection pool. The migrated Integration Server instance cannot connect to
all of the databases. 

To resolve this issue, when the user opts to use a clone of the live database
for the JDBC connection pool, the migration utility prompts for the password for
all JDBC connection pool aliases. Furthermore, the migration utility saves the
encoded password in the migrate.dat file by default. 

However, saving the encoded password in the migrate.dat file represents a
security vulnerability. The new server configuration parameter
watt.migrate.hidePassword controls whether an encoded database password for a
JDBC connection pool alias will be saved in migrate.dat. Set
watt.migrate.hidePassword to false in the migrate.bat/sh file on the target
Integration Server for the migration utility to save the encoded database
password. Set to true to omit database passwords for JDBC connection pool
aliases from the migrate.dat file. The default is false. Set the
watt.migrate.hidePassword value on the target Integration Server before running
the migration utility. 

Example of setting watt.migrate.hidePassword in migrate.bat:

%JAVA_EXE% -Dwatt.migrate.hidePassword=true
-Dwatt.migrate.product.dataProvider=com.wm.app.b2b.server.migrate.MigratorAppDataProviderImpl
-Dwatt.installer.migrate.destDir="%IS_DIR%"

Example of setting watt.migrate.hidePassword in migrate.sh:

$JAVA_RUN $JAVA_D64 -Dwatt.migrate.hidePassword=true

Changes to Integration Server to address vulnerability to Server-Side Request
Forgery (SSRF) attack. 

Integration Server can now be configured to perform SSRF checking on outbound
server connections. Integration Server provides server configuration parameters
that can be used to enable SSRF checking on direct connections and redirect
connections. 

watt.net.http.connect.performSSRFcheck - Specifies whether SSRF checking is
performed for direct outbound connections. When SSRF checking is performed for
direct outbound connections, Integration Server verifies that the host to which
the request is being sent is on the allow list established by the
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist parameter. If the host is not on the allow list,
Integration Server rejects the request with the error "Connection to URL {0} is
not permitted." Set to true to enable SSRF checking for direct outbound
connections. Set to false to disable SSRF checking for direct outbound
connections. The default is false. A value of true is more secure. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

watt.net.http.redirect.performSSRFcheck - Specifies whether SSRF checking is
performed for redirected outbound connections. When SSRF checking is performed
for redirected outbound connections, Integration Server verifies that the host
to which the request is being redirected is on the allow list established by the
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist parameter. If the host is not on the allow list,
Integration Server rejects the request with the error "Redirection to URL {url}
is not permitted." Set to true to enable SSRF checking for redirected outbound
requests. Set to false to disable SSRF checking for redirected outbound
requests. The default is false. A value of true is more secure. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist - Specifies a comma-delimited list of regex
expressions for allowed host names for SSRF checking. If SSRF checking is
enabled for direct outbound connections and/or redirected outbound connections,
the host name to which the direct or redirected outbound request is being sent
must appear in the allow list established by this parameter. This parameter is
empty by default. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect.

Issues generating WSDL first web service consumer's connector service.

Separate operations are created as connector services when you import a WSDL
with multiple operations, single binding, and various ports within a service
element to create a web service consumer.

Every port under the service element points to a different SOAP location,
and the flow services generated for each operation reflect these SOAP locations
with associated bindings. For example, binding and binding_1. Issue is that for 
the subsequent operation(s), flow service is not generated under the binding_1 
branch. Therefore, the second port is not reachable.

For example, if calculator_add and calculator_subtract are two operations that
have different ports (port1, port2) and a single binding with the name "calc",
the following flow services are generated to show the association:
         port1: calc and
         port2: calc_1
         
For every operation, the branch labelled "/binding" has the generated flow
branches as "calc" and "calc_1", which is correct for the
calculator_add operation. However, for the calculator_subtract
operation, the "/binding" branch does not have the "calc_1" flow branch, which 
is incorrect.

Change to Integration Server to address security vulnerability to session
fixation attack. 

When a user accesses the Integration Server login page or an API call (GET
http://hostName:portNumber), a session ID can be viewed in the Cookies section
of the browser or in the postman collection for the API call. Integration Server
uses the same session token after the user authenticates successfully. This
leaves Integration Server vulnerable to a session fixation attack. 

Now, the Cookies section of the browser or in the postman collection for the API
call do not display the session ID details after the initial access to the login
page or the initial GET call, respectively. After Integration Server
successfully authenticates the user, Integration Server uses a new session ID.

Resolution to CRLF injection exposure for logging to the server log.

Integration Server does not check the logger message parameters for CRLF
injection. This leaves Integration Server vulnerable to a CRLF injection attack. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server now checks the Integration Server
logger message parameters for the presence of CRLF characters, specifically the
character sequences "\n", "%0A", "\r", or "%0D" in any case combination, when
watt.server.log.forbidCRLF is set to true. If the parameters contain the
character sequence, the newline characters ("\n" and "%0A") are replaced with
<CR> and the return characters ("\r" or "%0D") are replaced by <LF>. By default,
watt.server.log.forbidCRLF is set to false, which means Integration Server does
not check logger message parameters for the CRLF characters nor does it replace
the characters. A full description of watt.server.log.forbidCRLF follows. 

watt.server.log.forbidCRLF
Specifies whether Integration Server prohibits the carriage return/line feed
(CRLF) characters, specifically the character sequences "\n", "%0A", "\r", or
"%0D" in any case combination, in the Integration Server logger message
parameters. When set to true, Integration Server filters the logger message
parameters for the character sequence "\n", "%0A", "\r", or "%0D" any case
combination. If the message parameters contain the character sequence,
Integration Server replaces the newline characters ("\n" and "%0A") with
<CR> and replaces the return characters ("\r" or "%0D") with <LF>. Filtering
and forbidding CRLF characters in the logger message parameters can eliminate
the CRLF injection to the server log. When set to false, Integration Server does
not filter the Integration Server logger message parameters for the character
sequence "\n", "%0A", "\r", or "%0D" in any case combination before processing
the request. The default is false. A value of true is more secure. 

Integration Server must be restarted for changes to this parameter to take
effect.

Removal of host name from Broker client ID stored in dispatch.cnf to address
security risk. 

When Integration Server starts for the first time, Integration Server generates
a Broker client ID and stores it in the config dispatch.cnf. This ID contains
the IS server's hostname, which could be considered a security risk. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server no longer uses the hostname in the
dispatch.cnf file. Instead, Integration Server generates and uses a unique ID. 

Note that Integration Server creates the dispatch.cnf file the very first time
the server starts. Integration Server does not update the file upon subsequent
restarts. If you wish to change this ID, you must shut down Integration Server,
delete the dispatch.cnf file, and restart the Integration Server. Integration
Server generates a new UUID upon startup.

subsequent request also results in an HTTP 401 status code with the
"Invalid Session ID" message, which is an incorrect behavior.

The issue is due to not cleaning up the session and cookie IDs when
there is a rule violation.

This issue is resolved. Now, subsequent requests are successful.

PIE-75856 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
Integration Server now validates the watt.server.compile value to address remote
code execution vulnerability. 

The watt.server.compile value specifies the compiler command that Integration
Server uses to compile Java services that are 
developed using Designer. The compiler command is also used by the jcode
utility. However, Integration Server does not validate the value of this
parameter to ensure that it is a compiler command. The lack of validation leaves
Integration Server vulnerable to a remote code execution attack. 

Now, when the watt.sever.compile value is changed, Integration Server saves the
change only if the path ends with javac.exe or javac. If the new value does not
end with javac.exe of javaca, Integration Server displays the error message "The
value for watt.server.compile is not valid" and does not save the change.

Updates to ESAPI (OWASP Enterprise Security API) library included in Integration
Server. 

ESAPI library contained in /common/lib/ext/esapi.jar has been upgraded to
version 2.4.0.0 and a properties file has been added to ensure compatibility
with Integration Server when it is upgraded to a higher version. The previous
version of the ESAPI library was version 2.1.01. 

Upgrading to 2.4.0.0 resolves the following security vulnerabilities:

When the docker stop command is executed with a timeout value, Integration Sever
Administrator terminates immediately. However, the startContainer.sh script
within the container continues to run and does not stop until the timeout period
elapses. As a result, the container is accessible during the timeout period.
After docker stop command is issued for a containerized Integration Server, the

After updating Integration Server to use the latest Java version, the JSSE debug
appears to be routed to System.err stream. Integration Server had been
redirecting the System.err stream which resulted in the JSSE debug logs not

The webMethods messaging trigger fails with OutOfMemoryError.

If the webMethods messaging trigger receives a message with a custom

Microservices Runtime attempts to create a JDBC configuration file for a new
JDBC function in the configuration variables template (application.properties
file) but should not. 

When applying a configuration variables template, Microservices Runtime (or an
Integration Server with a Microservices license) attempts to create a JDBC
configuration file if the template lists a JDBC function that does not exist.
However, JDBC functions cannot be created via a configuration variables
template. 

Now, Microservices Runtime no longer attempts to create a JDBC configuration
file when applying a configuration variables template. 

PIE-76519 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
Integration Server incorrectly handles REST requests or responses for 
media types that do not have a registered content handler in Integration Server.

Consider a media type mapped to application/json or
application/xml using the watt.server.content.type.mappings
server configuration parameter. For example,
"watt.server.content.type.mappings=application/problem+json application/json".
When the REST request to Integration Server uses the media type
mapped using the server configuration parameter, the REST request
does not honor the server configuration parameter setting and does not 
decode or encode the data according to the mapped media type.

This issue is resolved. Now, the watt.server.content.type.mappings 
server configuration parameter is honored while processing REST 
requests and responses.

If an Integration Server (or Microservices Runtime) Docker image includes the
WmGRPC package and uses an Alpine image as the base image, the JVM crahes when
spinning up a container with the Integration Server Docker image. This occurs
because the WmGRPC package uses Netty but the Alpine image has musl libc which
is not supported by Netty. 

To resolve this issue, the gcompat package is installed when using an Alpine
image as the base image. 

PIE-76602 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
OpenAPI connector services do not support request and response compression.

This issue is resolved.

Now, the OpenAPI connector services support request and 
response compression if the "Content-Encoding" or "Accept-Encoding" 
headers contain gzip or deflate compression schemes.

If there is a "Content-Encoding" request header in an HTTP request, the 
connector service compresses the request before sending it to the provider. 
If Integration Server acts as a provider, then set 
watt.server.http.request.supportCompression to true so that Integration 
Server decompresses the payload based on the "Content-Encoding" request header.

If there is an "Accept-Encoding" request header in an HTTP request, the 
server sends a compressed response payload back to the connector service. 
The connector service decompresses the response payload before 
further processing. If Integration Server acts as a provider, 
then set watt.server.http.response.supportCompression to true, so 
Integration Server compresses the payload based on the "Accept-Encoding"
request header.

For more information on compression support, see
watt.server.http.request.supportCompression and 
watt.server.http.response.supportCompression in the Server Configuration 
Parameters section of webMethods Integration Server Administrator's Guide.

Creating a webMethods messaging connection alias via application of a
configuration variables template fails if the template does not specify a type
for the alias. 

A webMethods messaging connection alias is used to connect to Broker or
Universal Messaging. Attempting to create a messaging connection alias at
startup through application of a configuration variables template fails if the
templates does not specify the type property for the alias, specifically
messaging.<connectionAliasName>.type with possible values of UM or Broker. 

Now, the messaging.<connectionAliasName>.type property has a default value of
UM. If the messaging.<connectionAliasName>.type property is missing for a
messaging connection alias defined in a configuration variables template, the
alias can still be created when the template is applied. 

PIE-76674 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
Integration Server does not preserve the spaces in the string array values of 
REST requests. 

Consider that a Swagger document is imported as a REST provider and the 
document has a variable defined as a string array. If a REST request contains 
leading or trailing spaces for the values in the string array, Integration 
Server trims such spaces before passing the values to the target service.

This issue is now resolved.

Microservices Runtime does not apply user updates from the configuration
variables template. 

If a configuration variables template (application.properties) includes more

configured value in Microservices Runtime, then Microservices Runtime ignored
all user updates. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76724 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
Configuration variables log does not contain useful information for incorrect
key names and unresolved environment variables. 

If a configuration variables template (application.properties file) contains
incorrect key names, Microservices Runtime writes an exception to the
configuration variables log during template processing instead of an informative
message. 

The configuration variables log will now include informative messages for an
incorrect property key. Additionally, this fix addresses an issue in which an
unresolved environment variable prevented an asset from being created. 

PIE-76731 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
When testing a JDBC pool alias that was added or updated via application of a
configuration variables template, Microservices Runtime throws a
NullPointerException if the template specified a driver alias that does not
exist. 

If the configuration variables template (application.properties file) applied by
Microservices Runtime adds or updates a JDBC pool alias but either does not
specify a value for jdbc.<aliasName>.driverAlias or specifies an invalid value,
Microservices Runtime assigns the DataDirect Connect JDBC SQL Server Driver to
the pool alias. (The driver alias DataDirect Connect JDBC SQL Server Driver is
the default associated driver alias for a new JDBC connection pool alias).
However, if value for jdbc.<aliasName>.driverAlias  specifies an invalid value,
specifically a driver alias that does not exist, Microservices Runtime throws a
NullPointerException when the JDBC pool alias is tested. 

Microservices Runtime now throws a useful error message instead of a
NullPointerException in the above scenario.

parent -> child1 -> object
parent-> child2 -> object
Integration Server incorrectly identifies the schema as a cyclic reference
schema and fails to create a JSON document resulting in the exception:
Could not create a JSON document type: Definition of references could not be 
found for: #/definitions/child1,#/definitions/child2,#/definitions/object

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76893 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
The Content-Length header in the HTTP response is not correct.

Layered products, such as Trading Networks and Adapters, that run on Integration
Server may explicitly set the Content-Length header based on an expected
response. In these situations, downstream use of the pub.flow:setResponse and
pub.flow:setResponse2 services results in an incorrect Content-Length header
value being set in the HTTP response. 

To resolve this issue, the pub.flow:setResponse and pub.flow:setResponse2
services clear any previously set Content-Length header and calculate the
Content-Length header value using the newly set response content.

This issue is now resolved. Microservices Runtime places the Kubernetes variable
itself in the configuration variables template (i.e., $secret[secretName]. In
addition, Microservices Runtime no longer resolves an environment variable in

PIE-77050 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
As part of adopting "Logging as a Service" (LaaS) in Integration Server, the 
following switch allows you to convert the audit log entries written to the 
console to JSON format. 

-logformat type: This specifies the format to which Integration Server converts 
the server log and the audit log entries written to the console (STDOUT or 
computer screen). Specify "type" as json. 

Beginning with the 10.11 version, you can start a server instance from the 
command prompt as follows:
For Windows: bin\startup.bat  -log both -logformat json
For UNIX: bin/startup.sh -log both -logformat json 

To log audit entries to the console, you must also set the environment variable, 
"SAG_IS_AUDIT_STDOUT_LOGGERS" to a comma-separated list of the audit loggers 
that log audit entries to STDOUT. For example, WMSESSION, WMERROR. The logs
logged in the console would then be changed to the JSON format. 

Starting Integration Server with "-logformat json" has no impact on log files 
such as server.log and error.log.

A service for which service caching is enabled executes multiple times when it
is invoked concurrently. 

When a service for which caching is enabled is invoked by multiple threads
concurrently and there are no service results in cache due to a missing cache
record or expired results, Integration Server executes the service multiple
times. This is unnecessary overhead. 

Now, when a cached service for which no cached results are available is invoked
multiple times concurrently, only the first thread executes the service while
the other threads wait. After the first thread completes execution and update
the cache, other threads read the service results from cache.

Deployer overwrites ACLs assigned by a startup service.

The fixes for issues PIE-67094 and PIE-72539 introduced conflicting requirements
for package load sequence, specifically manual loading requirements conflicted
with package deployment requirements. This conflict was resolved for new package
deployments but not for package redeployments. 

The package loading sequence now works as expected for manual package loading
and package deployment and redeployment.  For deployments and redeployments,
Integration Server first applies ACLs contained within the deployable package
and then runs the startup services in the package. 

PIE-77272 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
Enhancement to service caching in Integration Server to cache and return the
declared signature only. 

Previously, when service caching was enabled for a service, Integration Server
caches values for the defined service signature and the entire output pipeline.
When Integration Server uses cached results, Integration Server returns the
entire cached output pipeline from the previous service invocation. The pipeline
includes the output fields explicitly defined in the cached service, as well as
any output fields produced by earlier services in the flow. This may result in
cached pipeline values overwriting the value of fields that are not declared in
the service output signature. Caching the entire output pipeline may consume
large amounts of memory and disk space. 

Integration Server now includes strict service caching in which Integration
Server caches and returns values for the parameters defined in the service
signature only. Whether Integration Server performs strict service caching is
determined by the value of the server configuration parameter
watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict. Strict service caching is enabled when
watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict is set to true. The previous caching
behavior in which the entire output pipeline is cached and returned is used when
watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict is set to false. The behavior set by the
watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict parameter applies to all services for
which results caching is enabled. 

watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict

Specifies whether Integration Server caches and returns values for the
parameters defined in the service signature only or if the entire output
pipeline is cached and returned as well. Set to true for Integration Server to
cache and return values for parameters in the service signature only. This may
be referred to as strict service caching. Set to false for Integration Server to
cache and return values for parameters in the service signature and the entire
output pipeline. Caching the entire output pipeline may consume large amounts of
memory and disk space. Additionally, returning the cached output pipeline may
result in overwriting the value of fields that are not declared in the service
output signature. The default value is false. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
take effect.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78012 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix6)
The temporary zip file created by the diagnostics utility is not deleted
automatically after it is downloaded. 

When the diagnostic utility executes, the utility generates a temporary archive
(zip file) in the directory Integration Server_directory
\instances\<instance_name>\logs and then downloads the file. The temporary
archive is not deleted after it is downloaded. Each time the diagnostic utility
runs, it generates a new diagnostic archive. Leaving the temporary archives
could exhaust disk space. 

Now, after the diagnostic utility creates and downloads diagnostic archive, the
utility deletes the temporary archive from Integration Server_directory
\instances\<instance_name>\logs directory.

In Integration Server, invoking pub.flow:getLastError repeatedly in a flow 
service increases the pipeline size leading to "out of memory" issues when the 
exceptions are high.

In Integration Server, invoking pub.flow:getLastError repeatedly in a flow 
service increases the pipeline size as the pipeline/lastError document has the 
lastError of all previous pub.flow:getLastError executions, which leads to 
"out of memory" issues when the exceptions are high.

This issue is now resolved by introducing the
"watt.server.getLastError.removeLastError" 
server configuration parameter. If this parameter is set to "true", Integration
Server removes the pipeline/lastError document from the output of the last 
invocation of the pub.flow:getLastError service. If set to "false" or not set, 
the pipeline/lastError document is retained. The parameter does not have a 
default value.

Integration Server restart is not required for the changes to take effect.

service execution fails with an error. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server encodes the special

Design-time performance improvements for web service descriptors and related

activities. Specifically, copy and delete actions on the web service descriptor
and its related assets may take far longer to complete than the time it took to
generate the assets originally. 

After applying this fix, Integration Server may show an improvement in the

New Prometheus metrics for reporting the number of server threads in use and the
maximum configured server threads. 

The /metrics endpoint now returns the following two server thread metrics for
Microservices Runtime (or an Integration Server with a Microservices license). 

sag_is_server_threads
The number of server threads from the server thread pool currently in use.
Prometheus Label: host
Metric type: gauge

sag_is_server_maxthreads
The maximum number of server threads in the server thread pool.

Integration Server does not honor the value of
watt.server.jndi.searchresult.pageSize when it is set to 0. 

When the watt.server.jndi.searchresult.pageSize server configuration parameter
is set to 0, Integration Server should retrieve all user groups from the LDAP
servers at once. That is, the LDAP search result should have paging disabled.
However, paging is not disabled. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74409 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server does not map a REST API request payload to the corresponding 
service input signature generated from a Swagger document containing empty 
definitions.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74425 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
In Integration Server, service requests using the JWT authentication fail with
a Null Pointer exception when "Max Global Skew" is not set.

In Integration Server Administrator > Security > JWT > Edit Global Claim
Settings, if "Max Global Skew" is not set and Integration Server tries to
verify the incoming service request, the JWT authentication fails with a Null
Pointer exception.

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server now defaults "Max Global
Skew" to "zero" if not set explicitly.

PIE-74752 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server does not provide an option to set the request timeout for 
executing a REST connector service.

This issue is resolved. Now, if you create or refresh a consumer REST API
Descriptor (RAD), the generated connector service signature contains a
"timeout" parameter in the input. The datatype of the parameter is String
and the parameter value is specified in milliseconds.
At runtime, Integration Server considers the value of the "timeout" parameter
as the timeout value for the request. For the existing connector
services, if the pipeline contains a "timeout" parameter, the
value of the parameter is honored as the request timeout.

PIE-74917 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
The pub.mime:getEnvelopeStream service execution fails with
"java.util.NoSuchElementException: No more headers".

The pub.mime:getEnvelopeStream service execution fails with the
error if the size of the mimeData input parameter exceeds
26214400 bytes (26 MB), the default value of the 
watt.server.mime.largeDataThreshold server configuration parameter.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74962 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Statistics data collection may cause delays in service execution.

In some circumstances, statistics data collection can cause delays in service
execution, including delays retrieving cached service results. Specifically, if
Integration Server experiences a delay in obtaining a JDBC connection and
inserting metrics data into the database, the delay can temporarily block
executing services. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server now uses a new event queue to process
metrics data separately. 

In addition, Integration Server no longer collects statistics for inbound
requests that do not resolve to an IS service. This reduces the volume of data
stored in the database. 

PIE-74963 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
When an Integration Server instance runs, changing the default HTTPS port 
number for another instance results in an exception. 

When one Integration Server instance runs with the default HTTPS port (5543) 
enabled, creating a second instance disables the default HTTPS port for that 
instance. Changing the default HTTPS port number for the second instance throws 
the "Listener must be disabled to update configuration" exception. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74974 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server incorrectly deletes a session created for a client when an ID
provider is used for authentication. 

When a client sends a request to Integration Server on a port that uses an
external Identity Provider, Integration Server redirects the client to the
Identity Provider's login page. Integration Server returns a session ID cookie
with the redirection response, but Integration Server discards the session
created for the client. After the OpenID authentication and authorization
process, the client is redirected back to its original request. The client then
supplies the cookie it was assigned. Because Integration Server discarded the
session associated with the cookie, the client cannot connect. 

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server does not discard the session
created for the OpenID request. After the OpenID authentication and
authorization process completes, the client can use the session.

During the REST connector service execution, if the server response is
an empty JSON array, then Integration Server throws ClassCastException.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-75544 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server throws "java.sql.SQLFeatureNotSupportedException:
Can't turn off auto-committing; transactions are not supported." while creating
a JDBC connection pool. 

By default, Integration Server sets the auto-commit flag to false without
checking the flag status of the associated JDBC pool, which leads to an issue in
some non-transactional databases such as Dremio, resulting in the exception.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server checks the auto-commit 
status of the JDBC pool before setting the auto-commit flag.

PIE-75546 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server throws NoClassDefFoundError when copy strategy is used for

Server. If no core fixes have been applied, the fix level will be 0. 

PIE-75608 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
webMethods messaging trigger fails when receiving a message that includes a
custom byte array from Universal Messaging. 

If a webMethods messaging trigger that subscribes to messages from Universal
Messaging receives a message with a custom byte array, attempts to decode the
message fail because the decoding logic in Integration Server assumes the byte
array is an encoded IData. Integration Server writes a message like the
following to the server log: 

trigger failed because of message decoding exception:
com.wm.app.b2b.server.dispatcher.exceptions.MessagingCoderException:
java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.wm.data.ISMemDataImpl cannot be cast to
class java.lang.Integer 

Now, when a webMethods messaging trigger receives a message that includes a byte
array from Universal Messaging, Integration Server first verifies the byte array
is IData. If it is, Integration Server proceeds with decoding the byte array. If
the byte array is not IData, Integration Server passes the encoded byte array to
the input pipeline for the trigger service. 

PIE-75613 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Under heavy load, server processing that relies on the
java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles class degrades resulting in high CPU usage and
OutOfMemoryExceptions. 

Integration Server can encode an Object as XML and decode the XML, if properly
encoded, back into an Object. The process of decoding XML uses the
java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles class during the creation of object instances.
Under heavy loads, the performance of the MethodHandles.lookup() method
degrades. This can create a bottleneck in the server's processing, eventually
leading to high CPU usage and OutOfMemoryExceptions. 

This has been resolved. The use of MethodHandles has been replaced.

PIE-75656 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server now includes information about the Log4j version that is in
use in the server log and in diagnostic data. 

During start up, Integration Server writes a message to the server log
identifying the Log4j version in use by Integration Server. For example: 

[ISS.0025.0076I] (tid=83) Log4j Version: 2.17.1

This message is written when the facility 0025 Server Initialization is set to
Info or a more verbose level. 

Additionally, when generating diagnostic data, Integration Server includes the
Log4j version in the ServerAbout.txt file. 

PIE-75691 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server logs a Trace level message as an exception during startup.

During startup, Integration Server reports the following exception message in
the server log:

service (org.apache.lucene.codecs.Codec) via java.net.URLClassLoader@xxxx:
org.apache.lucene.codecs.lucene87.Lucene87Codec. 

This message is incorrectly logged as an exception. The message is logged for
diagnostic purposes and should be logged at the Trace level. 

This issue is resolved. The above message is written to the server log only when
the facility 0045 Statistics (Data Collector) is set to the Trace level.

In Integration Server, the execution of REST APIs with the restv2 directive
is slow as the server searches for the RAD associated with the resource.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-70945 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server creates an invalid URL alias to access a resource when a
REST API Descriptor (RAD) is created or updated.

When a RAD is created or updated using an existing REST resource and the
'Base Path' is set to any of the Integration Server directives such as /restv2
or /rad, Integration Server creates an invalid URL alias with the directive
to access the REST resource. The incoming REST API requests that use the
directives are redirected to the RAD and the requests fail.

The issue is resolved now. A RAD is not saved if its 'Base Path' is set to
any of the Integration Server directives.

Integration Server shut down may take longer when many JMS triggers are running.

If hundreds of JMS triggers are running, shutting down Integration Server may
take a few additional minutes because each JMS trigger needs to be stopped. 

Now, the time needed to stop a JMS trigger has been significantly reduced,
leading to a faster shut down of Integration Server that runs many JMS triggers. 

PIE-73984 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Microservices Runtime does not start if a malformed application.properties file
was supplied. 

At start up, Microservices Runtime (or an Integration Server with a
Microservices license), applies a provided application.properties file to set
configuration information. However, if the file is not properly formatted,
Microservices Runtime does not start up. 

Now, if Microservices Runtime cannot apply an application.properties file
because the file is malformed, Micorservices Runtime logs errors about the
malformed file to the server log and error log.  Microservices Runtime writes
the following to the error log: Dynamic variables processor has encountered an

When generating a configuration variables template, Microservices Runtime does
not include a key that indicates a global variable is secure. 

Now, Microservices Runtime (or an Integration Server with a Microservice

When editing or viewing extended settings (server configuration parameters) on
the Settings > Extended page in the legacy Integration Server Administrator,
Integration Server masks the value of any parameter whose name ends with
"password" or "Password". However, when saving the parameter value,
Integration Server saves the mask instead of the actual value. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74331 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server now prohibits the use of carriage return/line feed (CRLF)
characters in a request URL. 

To eliminate the risk of CRLF injection to the server log via an HTTP request,
Integration Server now filters the request URL for the presence of the CRLF
characters, specifically the character sequences "%0D%0A" or "%0A%0D" in any
case combination If request contains the character sequence, Integration Server
returns a HTTP 404 status code with the error message "URL not found. CRLF
characters are not permitted in a URL." Integration Server does not process the
request. 

Integration Server includes a server configuration parameter to control whether
Integration Server filters HTTP request URLs for the CRLF characters. A full
description of the parameter follows. 

watt.server.http.url.forbidCRLF
Specifies whether Integration Server prohibits the carriage return/line feed
(CRLF) characters, specifically the character sequences "%0D%0A" or "%0A%0D" in
any case combination, in the URL for an inbound HTTP request. When set to true,
Integration Server filters inbound HTTP request URLs for the character sequence
"%0D%0A" or "%0A%0D" in any case combination. If the request contains the
character sequence, Integration Server returns a HTTP 404 status code with the
error message "URL not found. CRLF characters are not permitted in a URL."
Filtering and forbidding CRLF characters in the HTTP request URL can eliminate
the CRLF injection to the server log via an HTTP request. When set to false,
Integration Server does not filter HTTP request URLs for the character sequence
"%0D%0A" or "%0A%0D" in any case combination before processing the request. The
default is true, which is more secure. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

PIE-74338 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Enhancements to is_instance script to apply fixes to new instances
automatically. 

The create command in the is_instance script now includes parameters for
specifying Software AG Update Manger information. The create command uses this
information to install the most recent updates applied to another Integration
Server instance to the new instance automatically. At the same time, the script
also uses Update Manager to update existing instances within the Integration
Server installation with the same updates. After creating a new instance, all
instances of Integration Server running on the same host machine and within the
same installation will be at the same fix level. You do not need to shut down
the existing Integration Server instances prior to running the script to create
an instance. 

The new parameters for the create command are as follows:

-Dsum.install.dir=<SUM_installation_location>
-Dsum.image.location=<SUM_image_location>
-Dsum.server=<fix_server_URL>
-Dsum.empower.user=<empower_user>
-Dsum.empower.password=<empower_password>

Where

<SUM_installation_location> Optional. The absolute path to the Software AG
Update Manager installation, specifically the path to the SAGUpdateManager
directory. If you do not specify a value, the script looks for Update Manager in
the current Integration Server installation directory. 

<SUM_image_location> Optional. Absolute path to the location of the Update
Manager installation image. Update Manager can install fixes from an
installation image. If you do not specify a value, the script looks for Update
Manager itself, as opposed to an image, in the current Integration Server
installation directory. For more information about creating installation images,
see the Using Software AG Update Manager documentation. 

<fix_server_URL> Optional. URL of the server from which to download fixes. If
you do not specify a value, the script looks for a fix server URL in the Update
Manager cache. 

<empower_user> Optional. User name for connecting Update Manager to Empower. If
you do not supply a empower_user, the script looks in the Update Manager cached
for credentials that Update Manager previously used to connect to Empower. For
more information about connecting to Empower from Update Manager, see Using
Software AG Update Manager. 

<empower_password> Optional. Password for connecting Update Manager to Empower.
If you do not supply empower_password, the script uses the cached credentials
which Update Manager previously used to connect to Empower. For more information
about connecting to Empower from Update Manager, see Using Software AG Update
Manager. 

Note: If you specify empower_user, you must also specify empower_password.

In addition to the above changes, the delete command for the is_instance script
now includes the following parameter: 
-Dsum.install.dir=<SUM_installation_location>

Where

<SUM_installation_location> Optional. Absolute path to the Update Manager
installation location, specifically the path to the SAGUpdateManager directory.
If you do not specify a value, the script looks for Update Manager in the
current Integration Server installation directory. The script uses the location
information to remove OSGi fix installation metadata for the profile for the
instance that is being deleted.

webMethods messaging triggers stop receiving messages when Universal Messaging
is configured to use a shared thread pool. 

If Universal Messaging is configured to use a shared thread pool and a fully
active, concurrent webMethods messaging trigger is suddenly restarted, the
trigger may stop receiving messages. (A trigger is considered fully active when
all of its processing threads are invoking services.) This situation occurs
because the trigger may continue to block the incoming notification thread from
Universal Messaging after the trigger abruptly restarts. If Universal Messaging
is configured to use a shared thread pool, the notification thread will not be
interrupted. As a result, the notification thread will not be able to deliver
new messages. 

To resolve this issue, the notification thread is released whenever a webMethods
messaging trigger is stopped.

Change to Integration Server to mitigate Zip security vulnerability in
Files.unzip() method. 

Directory traversal with and without Zip Slip and the Zip Bomb security
exploitation is possible with the method Files.unzip() which is part of
is-client.jar. 

To prevent exploitation of these security vulnerabilities, Integration Server
now included a server configuration parameter that specifies the maximum size of
a zip file that can be unzipped by this method. 

watt.server.maxzipfilesize
Specifies the maximum zip file size (in MB) that can be unzipped by
Files.unzip(). When this parameter is set to any value greater than or equal to
0, Integration Server checks the size of the zip file called by Files.unzip. If
the zip file is greater than the limit set by watt.server.maxzipfilesize,
Integration Server throws an exception and does not unzip the file. Set to -1 to
skip checking of the zip file size for Files.unzip(). The default is -1. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-74867 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Frequent reconfiguration of Log4j2 may cause a memory leak in Integration
Server. 

Integration Server versions 10.5 and higher use Log4j2. When the Log4j2
configuration gets changed by any component, Integration Server loses its own
Log4j2 configuration. To recover its configuration, Integration Server monitors
the Log4j2 configuration changes and logs the following message to wrapper.log
and server.log: Integration Server detected loss of its Log4j configuration.
Integration Server is restoring its Log4j configuration. However, when
reconfiguring its logging configuration, Integration Server leaves behind the
previously used Log4j2 appenders. Over a period of time, this could cause a heap
exhaustion issue. 

This issue is resolved. Now, when Integration Server reconfigures its logging
configuration, Integration Server discards the older Log4j2 appenders properly. 

PIE-74880 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server retains the previous provider filters in the Universal

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74923 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server has a performance degradation issue. 

Integration Server is unresponsive under heavy load leading to performance

PIE-74925 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
A request to Integration Server fails with 415 Unsupported Media Type if
watt.server.content.type.mappings maps application/merge-patch+json to another
content-type. 

Beginning in version 10.11, Integration Server supports the
application/merge-patch+json media type. The PATCH operations in Integration
Server Administrator API support the JSON Merge Patch specification, 
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc739, which requires a client to use the
application/merge-patch+json media type. However, if the
watt.server.content.type.mappings mapped application/merge-patch+json to another
content-type (such as application/json), a request with the Content-Type
application/merge-patch+json fails with the 415 Unsupported Media Type error. 

Now, if the watt.server.content.type.mappings maps application/merge-patch+json
to another content-type, Integration Server use the content-handler for the
mapped content-type as long as the request is not a PATCH request for the
Administrator API. Requests to the Administrator API include the directive
"admin". 

Additionally, Integration Server now prevents the
watt.server.content.type.mappings from mapping another content-type to
application/merge-patch+json. If the watt.server.content.type.mappings value is
changed to include <wildcard> < application/merge-patch+json>, Integration
Server Administrator displays the following error: The Content-Type mapping to
application/merge-patch+json is not allowed.

Change to limit OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens created by Integration
Server to 32 bytes. 

In Integration Server 10.7, OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens created by
Integration Server increased in length from 32 bytes to 64 bytes. The longer
tokens are more secure. However, for legacy applications that store tokens in
fixed-length fields, this increase in size may create a problem. The longer
tokens cannot be stored in in fixed-length fields that are less than 64
characters. 

This has been resolved with the introduction of the server configuration
parameter, watt.server.oauth.token.short. Values for this parameter are true and
false. When set to true, access tokens and refresh tokens will be 32 bytes. When
set to false, access tokens and refresh tokens will be longer than 32 bytes. As
of April 2022, the longer tokens are 64 bytes. The tokens may increase in size
in the future. The default for watt.server.oauth.token.short is false, meaning
Integration Server will create longer access and refresh tokens by default.
Changes to watt.server.oauth.token.short take effect immediately. A server
restart is not needed. 

PIE-75124 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server does not log the correct thread ID in the server log.

In each server log message, Integration Server should include the thread ID
(tid) of the thread handling the request. However, Integration Server used the
ID of the background thread, resulting in all messages having the same thread
ID. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-75277 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
Support for OpenID Connect private_key_jwt authentication.

When Integration Server acting as an OpenID Connect Relying Party requests a
token from an OpenID Provider's token endpoint, Integration Server can now use
the private_key_jwt authentication method. In this case, Integration Server will
generate a JWT (JSON Web Token), sign it with a private key, and include it in
the body of the token request. 

Using private_key_jwt authentication requires configuration external to
Integration Server and on Integration Server. 

Prior to configuring private_key_jwt authentication, verify that your OpenID
Provider supports it. 

To use private_key_jwt authentication, take the following configuration steps:

1. Make sure that you have a public/private key pair in a Java keystore.
Integration Server will use the private key to sign the JWT it sends to the
OpenID Provider. The OpenID Provider will use the public key to verify the
signature on the JWT. 

2. On the OpenID Provider, make sure that you have a client that corresponds to
your Integration Server and is configured to use private_key_jwt authentication.
Provide the public key from step 1 to the OpenID Provider. 

3. Using Integration Server Administrator, create a Keystore alias and key alias
for the keystore and key in step 1. 

4. Use a text editor to open the OpenID Provider configuration file located at:
<IntegrationServer>\instances\<instanceName>\config\security\openid 

5. Set the following fields in your OpenID Provider configuration file.
"token_endpoint_auth_method" : "private_key_jwt",
"client_id" : "<the client_id of your Integration Server on your OpenID
Provider>", 
"private_key_jwt_keystore_alias": "<keystore alias from step 3>",
"private_key_jwt_key_alias": "<key alias from step 3>",
"redirection_endpoint_host" : "<host name/IP address of the redirection endpoint
provided to your OpenID Provider>", 
"redirection_endpoint_port" : "<port number of the redirection endpoint provided
to your OpenID Provider>" 
Note: The redirection endpoint that you configure on the OpenID Provider is
https://HOST:PORT/invoke/wm.server.security.openid/codeCallback, where HOST and
PORT are the redirection_endpoint_host and redirection_endpoint_port values in
the OpenID Provider's configuration file in Integration Server. 

6. On the Security > OpenID page in Integration Server Administrator, click the
Reload OpenID Providers link to pick up the changes you made to the
configuration file. 

7. Create one or more OpenID Provider users for the users authenticated by the
OpenID Provider. Add these users to groups to give them the desired level of
access. 

8. Create an HTTPS port with the Client Authentication set to Use Identity
Provider and the Identity Provider set to your OpenID Provider. Set the Access
Mode and IP Access as needed and enable the port. 

PIE-75444 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
During start up, Integration Server writes the AdminAPIException "Cannot
initialize the administrative API for Adapter Runtime" to the server log even
though the WmART package is not present. 

If the WmART package is not present, Integration Server writes the erroneous
error "Cannot initialize the administrative API for Adapter Runtime" to the
sever log during the startup sequence. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-75456 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix4)
As part of adopting "Logging as a Service" (LaaS) in Integration Server, the 
following switch allows you to convert the log entries written to the console 
to the JSON format. 

-logformat type: This specifies the format to which Integration Server converts 
the log entries written to the console (STDOUT or computer screen). Specify 
"type" as json. 

Beginning with the 10.11 version, you can start a server instance from the 
command prompt as follows:
For Windows: bin\startup.bat  -log both -logformat json
For UNIX: bin/startup.sh -log both -logformat json 

"-logformat json" has no impact on log files such as server.log, error.log, and 
ehcache.log.

DTS-1750 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
In the Integration Server Administrator dashboard, the Services instances tab on
the Services tab displays "No services" even when services are currently
running. 

On the Services tab of the Dashboard, the Service instances tab displays the
text "No services" even when services are currently running. This is because the
tab only showed metrics for services that have executed to completion. 

Now, the Services instances tab will include running services that have not
executed to completion. 

PIE-69312 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server does not retain client sessions while invoking stateless
services from a Dynamic Server Page (DSP), which leads to repeated requests for
user credentials.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-70339 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
The byte[] and the byte data type conversions using IDataJSONCoder in 
Integration Server are incorrect. 

When using the IDataJSONCoder in Integration Server, the byte[] and the byte 
data type conversions are incorrect. The data of type byte[] gets converted to 
a Java class representation and byte to a string representation. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-70913 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Improved handling of user sessions in Integration Server.

After applying a fix or installing a release that includes PIE-62998,
Integration Server allows a local user to have the same name as a user in an
attached user directory (i.e., LDAP or Central User Management). However, when
resuming a session for the user defined in LDAP or Central Users, Integration
Server could resume the session for the local user instead. This is a security
vulnerability as the local user would be impersonating the user in LDAP or
Central Users. 

Additionally, when deleting or disabling a local user, Integration Server does
not immediately invalidate a session for the user if one exists. Instead, the
local user can continue using Integration Server until the session expires. This
is also a security vulnerability. 

To resolve these issues, Integration Server now tracks the source of the user
(i.e., local, LDAP, or Central Users) throughout the life of the user's
session. This ensures that Integration Server reuses cached authentication only
for a user that has been authenticated for that session. Additionally, when
deleting or disabling a local user, Integration Serve removes any existing
session for the user immediately and removes any cached authentication for the
user. 

PIE-71475 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
The server logger for Microservices Runtime logs information messages of the
Maverick SFTP client library. 

By default, the logging level for server logger in Microservices Runtime is
Info. However, information messages of the third-party Maverick SFTP client
library are also logged in the server logs. This issue does not occur when the
logging level is set to Warn. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71676 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Client certificates updated from one Integration Server in a cluster do not

PIE-71794 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
A REST API request that uses OAuth or API Key-based authentication fails.

A REST API request with OAuth or API Key-based authentication to Integration
Server fails with the "401 Unauthorized" error because the request does not 
contain the 'Authorization' header.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71893 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Designer throws NullPointerException for updating a document type in a service.

In Designer, if a package contains a Dynamic Server Page (DSP) that invokes
a service, the DSP acts as a dependent element for the service. However, 
updating a document type in the service throws NullPointerException as the DSP 
is not a node.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72377 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server runs out of available threads leading to performance 
degradation. 

When API Gateway server is unreachable, disabling the API Gateway ports does 
not remove the listeners created but enabling the ports creates new listeners. 
Hence, additional listeners are created to listen to API Gateway server 
requests leading to performance degradation. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72514 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
During repository-based deployment, Integration Server reloads packages
repeatedly. 

Integration Server reloads packages repeatedly during repository-based
deployment. A previous attempt to fix the issue PIE-66922 did not fully resolve
the issue and created another issue where some dependent packages did not reload
at all. Fixes that include PIE-70265 rolled back the changes made in PIE-66922.
As a result, Integration Server once again reloaded packages over and over again
during repository-based deployment. 

Now, the above issues have been addressed. Integration Server reloads dependent
packages only once during repository-based deployment. 

PIE-72571 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server generates a TCP RST (reset) signal when closing an outbound
socket connection. 

Now, Integration Sever no longer generates a TCP RST signal when closing
outbound socket connections. 

PIE-72626 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server appears to become unresponsive.

When the data statistics engine used by the Dashboard in Integration Server
Administrator gathers information about JVM thread states, performance may
degrade to the point that Integration Server appears unresponsive for several
seconds. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72661 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Incorrect password used for keystore and truststore aliases with the same name
but different passwords. 

If a keystore alias and a truststore alias have the same name, Integration
Server uses the same password handle for both aliases. However, when the
keystore and truststore alias have different passwords, Integration Server might
use the wrong password for the alias. 

Now, Integration Server always uses different password handles for keystore and
truststore aliases. 

PIE-72772 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Server threads used for processing messages received by concurrent webMethods
messaging triggers appear to be blocked. 

Server threads used to process message for concurrent triggers appear to be
blocked due. The way in which Integration Server creates datetime objects
introduces a bottleneck for server threads and results in threads being blocked. 

This fix changes the way in which Integration Server creates datetime objects to
reduce the potential of a bottleneck for server threads. 

PIE-72923 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server returns "400 Bad Request" for "GET" REST API requests with a
body. 

Integration Server expects "GET" REST API requests without a body. However, when
a GET REST API request has a body, Integration Server cannot process the request
and responds with "400 Bad Request". 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-73014 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
The "pub.file:getFile" service fails with the out-of-memory exception while
loading large files from local file systems.

While loading large files from local file systems using the
"pub.file:getFile" service with the "loadAs" parameter set to "stream", the 
service returns the file content as bufferedInputStream. However, the file load 
fails with the out-of-memory exception.

This issue is now resolved by introducing the "largeFile" optional
String input parameter in the "pub.file:getFile" service. By default, the value 
of the parameter is "false". Setting the parameter to "true" returns the
file content as FileInputStream, and also loads large files successfully.

PIE-73035 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server throws ClassCastException during a REST API invocation.

When a provider REST API descriptor is created from a Swagger document that has
one or more properties defined as a string and the format as date or date-time,
the generated service signature represents the properties as variables of type
Object with a Java wrapper type of java.util.Date. When the service is invoked,
the response contains java.util.Date type variables but the service returns a
string value instead of a Date object. As a result, Integration Server throws
ClassCastException. 

Now, for a service output variable defined to be of type Object with a Java
wrapper type of java.util.Date, Integration Server returns a Date object instead
of a String. 

Note: Previously, Integration Server returned a value of type string for dates
without causing a ClassCastException. To maintain compatibility with existing
implementations, Integration Server will not throw an exception when a service
returns a string value for a date type variable. However, Integration Server
does not check whether the string value is a valid date format.

PIE-73141 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server generates a document type with an additional field while
creating a REST API Descriptor (RAD) from a Swagger document, which causes 
mapping issues.

If a Swagger document imported in Integration Server as a provider or a
consumer has a definition with an array at the root level, the document type
generated using that definition has _generatedInput as the additional field. 
If the definition is used as a request or response body in an operation,
_generatedInput causes errors while mapping that data.

This issue is resolved. Now, for a Swagger definition with an array at the
root level, a document type is not generated, and the fields are directly
generated under the objects referring to that definition to resolve the mapping
issue.

PIE-73418 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Pipeline data is lost during the process execution.

When Integration Server receives a published document from a subscription 
trigger, a process instance starts with complete data. However, during the 
process transition, some pipeline data is not transferred to the next step of
the process, resulting in data loss.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-73438 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
The /health endpoint returns a status of UP for the JDBC indicator at startup
even if a JDBC function points to database that is not available. 

If a JDBC function is associated with a JDBC connection pool for which a
database connection cannot be established at startup, the /health endpoint
returns a status of UP for the JDBC indicator. When the JDBC function cannot
obtain the minimum number of database connections at start up, the JDBC function
fails to initialize. As a result, the JDBC functional alias is not included as a
part of the response returned from /health endpoint. The /health endpoint should
return a status of DOWN at startup but does not. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-73448 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server throws "java.lang.NullPointerException: null" for service
validation after repository deployment.

After deploying a Java service that does not have any input or output

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-73606 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
In Integration Server, a REST API invocation using the JWT authentication fails.

Integration Server does not support a REST API invocation using the JWT

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-73712 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Repository-based deployment for file polling ports does not include the File

PIE-73715 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
In a cluster, Integration Server threads are blocked at
wm.serverimp.getServerNodes() while waiting for a response from the Terracotta
Server. 

When an Integration Server is a member of a cluster, the server establishes a
remote server alias connection and creates a pinger thread that periodically
calls wm.serverimp.getServerNodes(). This results in a large number threads
making the same call which can result in blocked thread if the Terracotta Server
is not responding. 

To reduce the number of calls made to wm.serverimp.getServerNodes(), the pinger
thread now calls wm.serverimp.getServerNodes() only once at the time the
pinger thread is created.

Upgrade of Apache Lucene libraries to remediate security vulnerabilities.

The Apache Lucene libraries installed with Integration Server have been upgraded
to remediate the security vulnerability CVE-2017-12629
(https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12629) and the potential DoS attack
described in LUCENE-9981 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9981). 

The old libraries are:

The new libraries are:
- org.apache.lucene:lucene-core:8.10.1
- org.apache.lucene:lucene-grouping:8.9.0
- org.apache.lucene:lucene-queryparser:8.10.1
- org.apache.lucene:lucene-analyzers-common:8.10.1
- org.apache.lucene:lucene-suggest:8.9.0

Note: If you uninstall a fix that includes PIE-73733, you must manually delete 
files from the repository prior to starting Integration Server. 
See Section 9.0 Uninstallation for more information.

This issue is resolved now.

PIE-73837 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Updated JGit jar files.

Integration Server uses JGit to connect with Git repositories. Previously,
Integration Server included JGit jar version 3.3.2, which has the known

Administrator. 

Attempts to change the value of the watt.server.threadPoolMin parameter using
the Extended settings page in Integration Server Administrator fails with the
error "Invalid input - The Thread Pool Min cannot be greater than the Thread
Pool Max." This occurs even when the provided value is less than
watt.server.threadPool (Thread Pool Max). 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74009 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
OAuth scope matching does not work for multiple scopes.

When an OAuth access token is associated with multiple scopes and a resource is
requested that does not match the last of those scopes, the request is denied
with a 401 response. This happens even if the requested resource is in one of
the other scopes on the token. 

This issue is resolved. If a requested resource matches any of the scopes for an
access token, the resource is considered within the scope of the token.

Updates to webMethods Metering to exclude transactions for services in the
WmOptimize package.

PIE-74072 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-67760, service caching might not work.

After applying a fix that includes PIE-67760, invocation of a service whose
results are cached might return empty output. The solution in PIE-67760 changed
the way in which Integration Server cached service results to encode the data
prior to serializing it and placing it in the cache. This change resolved a
StackOverflowError that can result when caching complex data types with many
nested levels. However, the change to PIE-67760 prevents proper deserialization
of results for some data types. 

To address this issue, Integration Server now includes the server configuration
parameter watt.server.serviceResults.cache.encode which controls whether
Integration Server encodes data before serializing it. 

watt.server.serviceResults.cache.encode
Specifies whether Integration Server encodes service results before serializing
it and placing it in the service results cache. Set this parameter to true if
Integration Server encodes service results before serializing the results and
placing the data in the service results cache. A value of true may prevent a
StackOverflowError when the service results contain complex data types with many
nested levels. However, a value of true prevents proper deserialization of
results for some data types and might result in empty output. Set this parameter
to false if Integration Server does not encode service results before
serializing the results and placing the data in the service results cache. The
default value is false. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

Note: The default value of watt.server.serviceResults.cache.encode is false
which indicates that Integration Server does not encode data before serializing
it. This is the behavior that existed prior to application of a fix that
includes PIE-67760. Installing a fix that includes PIE-74072, reverts
Integration Server to the caching behavior available prior to applying
PIE-67760. If you want the caching behavior available in PIE-67760 (encoding the
data before serializing it), set watt.server.serviceResults.cache.encode to true
and restart Integration Server. 

PIE-74202 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
In Extended settings, the watt.server.idr.createScheduledTask and

Enhancement to the new Integration Server Administrator to support single
sign-on using X509 certificates. 

When accessing the new Integration Server Administrator via an HTTPS port that

Now, if the certificates provided by the browser successfully authenticate the
user, Integration Server Administrator logs in the user automatically and
displays the dashboard. 

PIE-74343 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
A java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException occurs because the REQUIRE_PKCE column is not
added to the IS_OAUTH_CLIENTS table in DB2. 

After applying a fix that includes PIE-71960, which introduces the ability to
require PKCE per OAuth client, Integration Server dynamically adds the
REQUIRE_PKCE column to the IS_OAUTH_CLIENTS table when the server starts. This
modification to the IS_OAUTH_CLIENTS table fails for DB2, resulting in a
java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException. 

This has been resolved by moving the database table modification for OAuth out
of Integration Server and into separate SQL scripts that can be executed by the
Software AG Database Component Configurator. 

PIE-74377 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
Repository-based deployment of email settings fails due to NullPointerException.

Variable substitution for obtaining the password used with email configuration

The output signature of the pub.json.schema:validate service has the "code"
string field in the "errors" Document List. When the service runs,
the output has the "error" string field instead of "code", causing a 
discrepancy with the output signature.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-74395 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix3)
In Integration Server Administrator, if CSRF Guard is enabled, the "Edit FTPS

Integration Server recreates the Universal Messaging durable subscription
for a channel even when the associated trigger is deleted.

If a webMethods messaging trigger is removed during Integration Server

PIE-72555 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
Delay in updating complex flow services.

Updating a flow service with complex pipeline mappings and several document
references requires Designer to constantly communicate with Integration Server
to reconcile the pipeline mappings, which causes the delay.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server reconciles the pipeline
mappings. 

Note:
As the reconciliation logic is removed from Designer, install this Integration
Server fix with the corresponding Designer fix to resolve the issue.

PIE-73629 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
Attempt to create messaging assets via application of a configuration variables

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-70325 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
Creating a REST API descriptor (RAD) from a Swagger document with the OAuth

A RAD with the OAuth security scheme is not supported in a Cloud environment.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server is updated to ignore the scopes
for the OAuth security scheme in a Cloud environment.

PIE-72064 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
Enhancement to Integration Server to control whether a package reloads after a
package that is dependent on it is replaced. 

A package in Integration Server can be identified as dependent on another
package if it references or uses assets from that package. For example, if a
service in package A invokes a service in package B, package A is dependent on
package B and a package dependency should be identified. Establishing a
dependency ensures that packages cannot be active until all dependencies are
met. Additionally, in hot deployment, Integration Server uses package
dependencies to wait for requests to complete before starting the deployment and
to block new requests for services in the deployed package as well as dependent
packages. 

When a package reloads or is replaced via hot deployment, Integration Server
reloads the packages that depend on it as well (that is, Integration Server
reloads all the packages that have established a dependency on the package being
reloaded/replaced). Reloading dependent packages refreshes any cached assets.
During hot deployment, reloading dependents can cause service requests to time
out, especially if package dependencies are complex. In some cases, such as
when there are no shared cached assets among the packages, reloading dependent
packages does not provide any benefit. Preventing dependent packages from
reloading may provide a performance improvement. To address this, Integration
Server now includes a property that can be added to the package manifest to opt
out of being reloaded when the package on which it depends is reloaded or
replaced. 

To prevent a package from reloading when the package on which it depends is
reloaded or replaced, do the following: 

1. Use a text editor to open the package manifest file.
For Integration Server, the package manifest file is located at:
<SAG_HOME>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instanceName>/packages/<packageName>/manifest.v3.
For Microservices Runtime, the package manifest is located at:
<SAG_HOME>/IntegrationServer/packages/<packageName>/manfiest.v3. 

2. Add the following within the Values element tag:
<value name="reloadWithDependentPackage">false</value>

3. Save your changes to the manifest.v3 and close the file.

You do not need to reload the package or restart Integration Server for changes
to take effect. 
If the property reloadWithDependentPackage does not exist in a package manifest,
Integration Server reloads the package whenever packages it depends on are
replaced or reloaded. The default value of reloadWithDependentPackage is true.

An application.properties file contains only one set of LDAP configuration asset
properties when there are multiple LDAP directories. 

When generating an application.properties file for a Microservices Runtime (or
an Integration Server with a Microservices license) that has multiple LDAP
directories that use the same directory URL, the application.properties file
contains only one set of LDAP configuration asset properties instead of one set
per LDAP directory. This is because the LDAP asset properties in an
application.properties file use the LDAP directory in the key name. 

To resolve this issue, the key names for LDAP configuration properties now use a
UUID automatically generated by Microservices Runtime instead of the LDAP
directory. For example: 

Directory URL: ldap.<uuid>.url
Principal: ldap.<uuid>.prin
Credentials: ldap. <uuid>.password

When using an application.properties file to create an LDAP configuration, make
sure to specify a unique value in the UUID portion of the key name. 

PIE-72229 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
The "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID" scheduled task causes performance 
degradation in databases with DB archiving. 

Integration Server runs "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID" periodically to 
remove the expired entries from the WM_IDR_MSG_HST table. However, for a 
Microsoft SQL Server database, if the lock escalation is not configured 
correctly, the task degrades the database performance. 

This issue is resolved. Integration Server automatically schedules the task if 
the "Document History" functional pool alias is configured. Now, Integration 
Server provides the "watt.server.idr.createScheduledTask" parameter with default
value "true" to manage "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID". 
Add the parameter with value "false" in "Integration Server Administrator > 
Settings > Extended > Edit Extended Settings" if any sweeper tasks are active or 
performing DB archiving. The configuration does not require a server restart. 
However, restart the "Document History" functional pool alias to apply the change. 

Note:
If the "watt.server.idr.createScheduledTask" value is set to "false",
Integration Server does not schedule the task. To schedule the sweeper task for 
removing the expired entries, set the property to "true" and restart the server
or pool alias again.

The "pub.client:restClient" service generates an invalid output for a compressed

If the response to the "pub.client:restClient" service is compressed and
contains a "Content-Encoding" response header, the service uses the compressed
response without decompressing, which returns an invalid output. 

This issue is resolved. Now, pub.client:restClient supports response compression
if the "Content-Encoding" response header contains gzip or deflate type
compression schemes.

Option to control whether a REST response includes empty fields.

If the output of a service used as a REST operation does not include a value for
a field defined in the output signature, Integration Server sets a null value
for the field and includes it in the REST response. However, Integration Server
should not include fields in the REST response if a value was not set for the
field in the service output. 

Integration Server now includes a server configuration parameter that controls
whether a REST response includes empty fields or omits them. 

watt.server.rest.includeNullFieldsInResponse
Specifies whether a REST response includes null values for fields for which a
value was not set by the service used as the REST operation. Set to true to use
a null value for empty fields and include them in the REST response. Set to
false to omit empty fields from the REST response. The default is true. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect.

PIE-70859 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server might take a long time to delete an OAuth client
registration. 

When deleting an OAuth client registration, Integration Server attempts to
remove all of that client's tokens from the cache and the database (API Gateway
stores tokens in ElasticSearch instead of a database) before deleting the
registration. In a clustered Integration Server setup, the caches are stored in
distributed cache. Removing the tokens from the distributed cache takes time
and, as a result, deleting a client registration might appear to take a long
time. 

To reduce the time for deleting an OAuth client registration in a cluster,
Integration Server now first deletes the client registration which results in
the automatic deletion of the tokens in the database (or ElasticSearch for API
Gateway). Integration Server then uses a background thread to clear the tokens
associated with the client registration from the distributed cache. When the
logging facility 0010 OAuth is set to the Debug level, Integration Server logs
the activities of the background thread to the server log. 

PIE-71316 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
When a REST API Descriptor (RAD) is created from a Swagger document and the 
connector services are invoked, the header values are not returned in the
output. 
When the RAD acts as a provider, the response does not have the header
variables. 

When a RAD is created from a Swagger document and the connector services are 
invoked, the header values are not returned in the output because the response 
headers are not added in the output signature of the generated connector
service. 
Similarly, when the RAD acts as a provider, the generated service does not have 
the header variables and hence cannot be set in the service implementation.

This issue is now resolved. The header variables are added in the output
signature of the generated services. Hence, the header values are returned in 
the output when the connector services are invoked. Similarly, when the RAD acts 
as a provider and receives a REST request from a client, the header values are 
added to the response headers.

PIE-71644 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server generates incorrect document type and service signature while
creating a provider or consumer REST API Descriptor (RAD) from a Swagger
document. 

If a Swagger document imported in Integration Server as a provider or as a
consumer has a definition that references another definition as an array at the
root level, the document type and service signature generated using that
definition is not correct, which results in incorrect output at runtime. 

This issue is now resolved by correcting the document types and service
signatures. 

Note: Despite applying the fix, the issue persists for the existing RADs.
Recreate or refresh the RADs to resolve this issue. To refresh a RAD, see
"Refreshing a REST API Descriptor" in webMethods Service Development Help. 

PIE-72142
Users defined in the Common Directory Service central users account cannot be
given read-only access to the Administrator API. 

To enable users with a common directory services to have read-only access to the
Administrator API, Integration Server introduces the following administrative
assets: 

- ReadOnlyAdministrators user group. All members of the ReadOnlyAdministrators
group have read-only access to the Administrator API. 
- ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL. Groups that are allowed access to the
ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL have read-only access to the Administrator API. The
new group ReadOnlyAdministrstors have access to the ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL. 

To give a local user (a user defined on Integration Server) read-only access to
the Administrator API, add the user to the ReadOnlyAdministrators group. 
To give a user in the Central Directory Service read-only access to the API, add
the group to which the user belongs to the ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL. 

The first time the WmAdmin package loads after applying a fix that includes
PIE-72142, Integration Server does the following: 

- Creates the ReadOnlyAdministrators user group if it does not exist.
Adds the users belonging to the group set as the value of the
watt.adminapi.group.readOnly server configuration parameter to the
ReadOnlyAdministrators user group. 
- Deletes the user group specified in the watt.adminapi.group.readOnly
parameter. 
- Creates the ReadOnlyAdministrators ACL and adds the ReadOnlyAdministartors
group to the allowed list for this ACL. 
- Deletes the watt.adminapi.group.readOnly server configuration parameter as it
is no longer needed. 

Note: Integration Server allows all users to access the OpenAPI file for a
product using the GET /admin/swagger/{productName} operation.

PIE-72677 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
After migrating to Integration Server 10.7, direct invocation of the OAuth token
endpoint service fails. 

If the redirection endpoint is a service on the Integration Server that is
acting as the OAuth authorization server, rather than issuing an HTTP or HTTPS
call, it is more efficient for that service to directly invoke
pub.oauth:getToken, the OAuth token endpoint service. However, after installing
a fix or migrating to a release that includes PIE-52533, this is no longer
working for confidential clients. The confidential client receives the error
message, "The authorization code supplied with the request was not issued to
this client." 

PIE-52533 updates Integration Server so that the OAuth token endpoint handles
client credentials in token requests in conformance with RFC 6749, the OAuth
specification. Specifically, PIE-52533 ensures that the authorization code
provided to the OAuth token endpoint service was issued to the client making the
request. 

While this is more secure and brings Integration Server behavior into accordance
with RFC 6749, the OAuth specification, the change may cause existing
implementations to end with the following error when the redirection endpoint
was directly invoking the OAuth token endpoint service located on the same
Integration Server: 

[ISS.0010.8039] The authorization code supplied with the request was not issued
to this client. 

This error now occurs because the change for PIE-52533 required confidential
clients doing an invoke of the token endpoint service to include their client_id
and client_secret in the input pipeline passed to the token endpoint service.
That is, a service functioning as the redirection endpoint that invoked the
token endpoint service on the same Integration Server needed to be updated to
include client_id and client_secret in the invocation pipeline. Integration
Server uses the client_id and client_secret information to ensure that the
client making the token request is the client to which the authorization code
was issued. 

Because it may not be practical to update existing solutions, Integration Server
now includes a server configuration parameter to control whether or not
Integration Server verifies that the confidential client supplying the
authorization code to the OAuth token endpoint service is the client to which
the authorization code was issued. 

watt.server.oauth.token.endpoint.local.requireSecret
Specifies whether Integration Server ensures that authorization code provided by
a confidential client invoking the OAuth token endpoint service was issued to
the confidential client when the OAuth token endpoint service is invoked
directly because it is on the same Integration Server acting as the OAuth
authorization server. When set to true, Integration Server uses the credentials
supplied by the requesting client to ensure that the authorization code provided
by the client requesting the OAuth token matches the credentials of the client
that requested the authorization code. The client_id and client_secret must be
in the input pipeline passed to the token endpoint service. When set to false,
Integration Server does not ensure that the authorization code provided by the
client matches the credentials of the client that actually requested the token.
The default is false, which is less secure. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to
watt.server.oauth.token.endpoint.local.requireSecret to take effect. 

Note: The watt.server.oauth.token.endpoint.local.requireSecret value applies
when getting an initial access token and when using a refresh token to get a new
access token. 

Note: Public clients doing an invoke of the token endpoint service on the same
Integration Server as the redirection endpoint must continue to include their
client_id in the input pipeline passed to the token endpoint service. 

Clients that use HTTP or HTTPS to request an access token from the OAuth token
endpoint must continue to send these requests as they have been. 
- Confidential clients must use their client_id and client_secret in the HTTP
Authorization header. 
- Public clients must include their client_id in the body of the request.

This issue is resolved.

PIE-72963 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server acting as an OAuth resource server does not include client_id

When Integration Server is acting as an OAuth resource server, it sends a token
introspection request to the OAuth authorization server. If Integration Server
uses a digital certificate to authenticate with an external authorization
server, the client_id and client_secret are not included in the introspection
request. 

This has been resolved. The client_id and client_secret are always included in
introspection requests sent to external authorization servers.

The resolution for PIE-69100 includes a modification to the custom_wrapper.conf
to define the override file for the java.security file. Application of the fix
that includes PIE-69100, adds the following parameter to custom_wrapper.conf:
wrapper.app.parameter.n= -
Djava.security.properties=config/security/webm_override_java.security where n is
105 for releases 10.5 and lower and 106 for 10.7. If an additional property with
that number already existed in custom_wrapper.conf, it might be overwritten. 

Integration Server adds the following comment to the beginning of the

To prevent conflicts with properties added by Software AG, add your custom
properties with 400 series numbers or higher unless otherwise instructed by
Software AG. 

This comment appears only in the custom_wrapper.conf file created for a new

Further, Software AG recommends that any new custom properties added to
custom_wrapper.conf be assigned a number of 400 or higher, i.e., when adding
wrapper.app.parameter.n to custom_wrapper.conf, set n to 400 or higher. Software
AG also recommends that any existing custom properties in the 100-399 range be
moved to 400 or higher to avoid conflicts with any properties added in future

When configuring proxy server settings on Integration Server Administrator, 
a tenant account is not enabled for a hybrid connection between an on-premise 
Integration Server and the cloud Universal Messaging.

When configuring proxy server settings on Integration Server Administrator, 
a tenant account is not enabled for a hybrid connection between an on-premise 
Integration Server and the cloud Universal Messaging, resulting in
nRealmUnreachableException because the HPROXY (host:port combination) 
and HAUTH (username:password combination) system properties are not set.

This issue is now resolved by introducing the "watt.net.proxy.proxyAlias" server 
configuration parameter. Provide the proxy alias name as a value for the server
configuration parameter on Integration Server Administrator > Settings > 
Extended, and restart Integration Server. This programmatically sets and
retrieves the values of HPROXY and HAUTH from the proxy configuration to 
establish a connection between Integration Server and the cloud 
Universal Messaging.

PIE-71832 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server Administrator displays an error for "Http failure during
parsing..." 

When the watt.server.http.useAcceptHeader parameter is set to false, Integration
Server serves out a response in the HTML format. However, the new Integration
Server Administrator expects a JSON response. This results in Integration Server
Administrator displaying an error beginning with "HTTP failure during parsing
for..." 

Now, Integration Server uses the JSON handler for all requests from the new
Integration Server Administrator. 

PIE-72015 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server logs an entry in the server log, even when no requests are 
waiting on the API Gateway registration port.

Integration Server logs an entry in the server log as "0 Requests are waiting"
when no requests are waiting on the API Gateway registration port, which might
trigger a false positive alarm.

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server does not log any entry in the 
server log when no requests are waiting on the API Gateway registration port.

PIE-68168 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The pub.flow:getLastError service output is not populated.

In rare circumstances, unusual internal server errors that occur while a flow
service is invoking another service prevent the pub.flow:getLastError service
output from being populated. 

This issue is now resolved. The rarely occurring, unusual error is now handled
by flow in the same way as typical errors. 

PIE-69889 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The "pub.mime:CreateMimeData" service throws the "[ISC.0064.9415] Encoding is
not supported" exception when the character set of the "input" parameter is
empty. 

The "pub.mime:CreateMimeData" checks the character set of the "input" parameter.
If the character set is "null", the service ignores the value and generates the
mime data. However, if the character set is either unsupported or empty, the
service throws the "[ISC.0064.9415] Encoding is not supported" exception. 

This issue is resolved now. Although the character set of the "input" parameter
is empty, the service generates the mime data. 

PIE-70089 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Scheduler logs a misleading "Could not complete last run" message.

Scheduled jobs do not run during database outage or Integration Server
maintenance, and the scheduler logs the "Could not complete last run" message,
which is misleading. 

The issue is now resolved by updating the message to "Couldn't find in running
task list" for better understanding. 

PIE-71091 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server becomes unresponsive.

A known issue in the Java class ReentrantReadWriteLock results in a deadlock
when accessing a class internal to Integration Server. 

To prevent the deadlock from occurring, this fix implements a minor
configuration change that works around the known issue in the
ReentrantReadWriteLock class. 

PIE-71229 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Memory leak in cron task queue due to immediate, one-time-only cron tasks never
being removed from the queue. 

When Integration Server issued an immediate, one-time-only cron task, the task
job was added to the cron queue but never removed. This resulted in a memory
leak. 

Now, immediate, one-time-only cron tasks are no longer added to the cron queue.
However, Integration Server still adds one-time-only cron tasks scheduled for
future execution to the cron queue. 

PIE-71548 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Thread deadlock in receiving and processing access token expiration
notifications. 

When Integration Server is in a cluster and receives notifications from the
Terracotta Server Array that an OAuth access token has expired, Integration
Server performs housekeeping operations on the token caches. These operations
are performed with the same thread that received the expiration notification
which can result in a thread deadlock. 

Integration Server now uses a dedicated thread for processing access token
expiration notifications. Because the token housekeeping operations are
performed by a different thread than the one receiving the expiration
notification, the thread deadlock does not occur. 

PIE-71549 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Fixes for the OAuth functionality.

This fix resolves two issues for the OAuth functionality.

- After applying a fix that contains PIE-67827, editing and then saving an OAuth
client registration that uses a confidential client results in the loss of the
client secret. Instead of saving the encrypted client secret value, Integration
Server saves the masked client secrete value of ******. 
Now, Integration Server saves the original encrypted client secret value and not
the masked value. 

- When using OAuth with a stateless cluster, the active access tokens may be
loaded into all of the Integration Servers in the stateless cluster. When the
access token expires, multiple Integration Servers in the stateless cluster may
try to remove the expired token. If one of the Integration Servers succeeds in
removing the expired token, attempts by other Integration Severs in the
stateless cluster fail with a NullPointerException. 
Now, a NullPointerException no longer occurs if another Integration Server
attempts to remove the same expired token. 

PIE-71594 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Service results caching performance seems to have degraded.

Blocked threads prevented retrieval of service results values from cache.

This issue has been resolved.

PIE-71632 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The ports on Integration Server running in a container cannot be accessed when
watt.server.inetaddress parameter is set to any value rather than the default
empty value. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71675 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
After creating a JDBC pool through application of a configuration variables
template, attempts to connect to the database fail because of incorrect
credentials. 

When creating a JDBC pool by applying a configuration variables template at
start up, the value for the database password is not handled correctly. This
results in the attempts to connect to the database failing because of incorrect
credentials. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-71773 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The internal service wm.server.access:setUserDisabled did not specify the
correct possible values for the mode input parameter. 

The wm.server.access.setUserDisabled service signature indicates that the valid
value for the mode input parameter are "ENABLED" and "DISABLED". However, the
service did a case-sensitive comparison of the supplied values against the lower
case "enabled" and "disabled". As a result, the service did not behave as
expected. 

Now, the service performs a case-insensitive check of the supplied mode value.

PIE-71858 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-66922, some packages are not getting
reloaded after deployment. 

The fix for PIE-66922 addressed the issue where Integration Server reloaded
packages over and over again during repository-based deployment. After the fix,
packages were to reload once only. However, some packages were not reloading at
all. 

To resolve this issue, the code changes added for PIE-66922 have been reverted.
Consequently, Integration Server will once again repeatedly reload some packages
during repository-based deployment. 

PIE-71946 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server seems to be running out of threads due to Designer sessions
ending abnormally. 

When Designer establishes a session on Integration Server, a socket monitor
thread is created for each session. The socket monitor thread uses an event
listener which waits for a shutdown event that, when received, will result in
the termination of the socket monitor thread and the return of the socket
monitor thread and event listener thread to the thread pool. If a Designer
session ends properly normally, the event listener on Integration Server
receives a shutdown event, the socket monitor thread ends, the event listener
thread ends, and both threads return to the server thread pool. However, if
Designer ends the session abnormally, that is, the sessions are killed, the
socket monitor thread and event listener thread remain on Integration Server
indefinitely. Over time, this results in high thread consumption from Designer. 

To address this issue, Integration Server includes the server configuration
parameter watt.server.event.monitor.timeout to set the socket timeout value so
that socket monitor threads will eventually terminate, allowing the socket
monitor thread and event listener thread to return to the server thread pool. 

watt.server.event.monitor.timeout
Specifies the number of seconds that elapse before the socket monitor thread
created for a Designer session times out, terminating its server thread and the
associated event listener thread. (Integration Server creates a socket monitor
for each Designer session. Each socket monitor uses an event listener to listen
for the shutdown event that occurs when a Designer session ends normally. The
socket monitor uses a thread from the server thread pool as does the event
listener.) The default is 0, which means the socket monitor waits indefinitely
and never times out. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to take effect. 

Important! Set the watt.server.event.monitor.timeout value with care as a value
that is too low may result in the premature termination of threads which could
impact the Designer session in unexpected ways. 

PIE-71960 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The OAuth implementation in Integration Server now supports Proof Key for Code
Exchange (PKCE) on a per client basis. 

Previously, Integration Server added support for PKCE in PIE-69002 which
introduced the global OAuth setting Require PKCE (which corresponds to the
watt.server.oauth.requirePKCE server configuration parameter). When Require PKCE
is set to yes, this setting requires all OAuth public clients to use PKCE with
the authorization code grant. Now, Integration Server provides the ability to
require use of PKCE on a client by client basis. 

The Security > OAuth > Client Registration > Edit client registration page in
Integration Server Administrator now has a Require PKCE field that sets the PKCE
usage requirement for a client. It has three possible values. 

- Use OAuth Global Setting. Whether the client is required to use PKCE is
determined by the value of the Require PKCE global setting (i.e., the
watt.server.oauth.requirePKCE parameter). If the value of  the Require PKCE
global setting changes, the client's requirement to use PKCE changes with it. 
- No. The client is not required to use PKCE.
- Yes. The client is required to use PKCE.

Because PKCE may be required for public clients only, the Require PKCE field is
enabled when the Type field is set to Public. The Require PKCE field is disabled
when the Type field is set to Confidential. 

Even if a client is not required to use PKCE, it may still do so to protect
itself against the authorization code interception attack. Use of PKCE is
strongly encouraged for all public clients using the authorization code grant.
See the description for PIE-69002 in the IS_10.7_Core_Fix4 Readme and
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636 for more information about PKCE
and what an OAuth public client must do to use it. 

PIE-71968 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
When using an external server as an authorization provider, the OAuth
authentication for a REST API request fails.

When using an external server as an authorization provider, Integration Server
fails to match the REST API request URL with the URL template configured for a
scope. This results in authentication failure.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71996 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Single sign-on with OpenID does not work when using the new Integration Server
Administrator. 

OpenID single sign-on does not occur when accessing the new Integration Server
Administrator directly using https://server:openid-port/WmAdmin/ where
openid-port is a port that uses an identity provider for authentication. Instead
of showing the OpenID provider's login page, Integration Server Administrator
displays a basic login dialog box. 

This issue is now resolved. Accessing the Integration Server Administrator using
https://server:openid-port/WmAdmin/ now shows the OpenID provider's login
page. 

PIE-72037 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-70758, an HTTP port cannot be created
using Integration Server Administrator on the diagnostic port. 

When creating an HTTP port while using Integration Server on the diagnostic
port, the Package Name field is not listed in the Ports > Add port > Edit HTTP
configuration page. An HTTP port cannot be created if it cannot be associated
with a package. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-72041 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Clicking the "Try the New Administration Console" link on the legacy Integration
Server Administration requires the user to log in again. 

After logging into the legacy Integration Server Administrator, clicking the
"Try the New Administration Console" link goes to the login screen and require
the user to log in again. 

This issue is now resolved. Clicking the "Try the New Administration Console"
link does not prompt the user to log in again to access the new Integration
Server Administrator. 

PIE-72346 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server returns a response in the default media type instead of the
requested media type when the Accept header in the request includes a media type
parameter. 

The presence of a media type parameter in the Accept header of an HTTP request
causes Integration Server to respond with the default media type of text/html
instead of the specified media type. For example, the following Accept header
includes a charset parameter. 

Accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8

Integration Server's response to a request with this Accept header uses the
default media type of text/html instead of the requested media type. 

This has been resolved.

PIE-72412 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The link to a service on the "Service Usage" page in Integration 
Server Administrator is broken.

On Integration Server Administrator > Server > Service Usage page, 
the link to a service breaks when the CSRF guard is enabled.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72420 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The "Return to Packages Management" and "Browse services in <Package name>"
links in Integration Server Administrator are missing.

On the Integration Server Administrator -> Packages -> Management -> <Package
name> page, the "Return to Packages Management" and "Browse services in <Package name>"
links are missing when the CSRF guard is enabled.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72441 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server Administrator responds slowly to a login attempt or a reload
of the homepage when metering is enabled. 

When metering is enabled, Integration Server periodically performs a "dry run"
of sending data to the webMethods Metering Server. During a dry run, Integration
Server simulates a connection to the webMethods Metering Server. Integration
Server performed a metering dry run after a user logs in to Integration Server
and when a user reloads the home page, resulting in a slow response to the login
attempt or the reload request. 

To prevent this delay, Integration Server now caches the results of the last dry
run and uses them after a login attempt or the request to reload the home page. 

PIE-72497 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Internal environmental variable not exported correctly to the startup script for
an Integration Server running in a Docker container. 

The startup scripts for an Integration Server running in a Docker container sets
an internal environment variable to notify processes executing within
Integration Server that it is being run in a container. However, the variable
was not exported to the startup script properly and was therefore not available
to the Integration Server. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-72511 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The default access settings for an HTTP port is not restored in Integration 
Server Administrator. 

On both new (<host:port>/WmAdmin) and legacy (<host:port>/WmRoot) Integration 
Server Administrator, enabling CSRF Guard breaks the "Reset to default access 
settings" link on the Security/Server > Ports > Edit Access Mode >
[http_port_name] page. Hence, the user cannot restore the default access 
settings for an HTTP port. 

The issue is resolved now.

PIE-72512 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The "Edit Account Locking Settings" link opens the "Password Expiration
Settings" page in Integration Server Administrator. 

On Integration Server Administrator > Security > User management > Account 
Locking Settings, the "Edit Account Locking Settings" link opens the "Password 
Expiration Settings" page instead of the "Edit account locking settings" page 
when the CSRF Guard is enabled. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72513 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The SFTP Client Version in Integration Server Administrator is "Version 
1" instead of "Version 2". 

When CSRF Guard is enabled, the default SFTP Client Version on both new (<host:
port>/WmAdmin) and legacy (<host:port>/WmRoot) Integration Server Administrator 
is "Version 1" instead of "Version 2". 

This issue is now resolved. The default is "Version 2".

PIE-72545 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The new Integration Server Administrator does not display the error log.

When the error logger writes log messages to a file, the new Integration Server
Administrator does display the error log contents in the Logs > Error page after
Integration Server rotates the error log at midnight. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72596 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
A user belonging to the Administrators group but not the Developers group cannot
access the Server > Log pages in Integration Server Administrator. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72598 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Updates to webMethods Metering to exclude transactions for services in the WmMFT
package. 

PIE-72909 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Publishing a document from Integration Server to Broker fails when the document
contains a reference document. 

When you create a document with a reference document inside it, synchronize the
document to Broker, and publish a message, the publish operation fails with the
"[ISS.0098.9007] Data does not conform to the Publishable Document Type
<DOC_NAME> errors: null" error due to the missing coder while encoding. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-73308 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The resolution for PIE-72497 does not solve the issue for Microservices Runtime.

The startup scripts for an Integration Server or Microservices Runtime running
in a Docker container sets an internal environment variable to notify processes
executing within Integration Server/Microservices Runtime that it is being run
in a container. The solution for PIE-72497 ensured that the variable was
exported to the startup script properly and therefore available to the
Integration Server. However, this did not solve the issue for Microservices
Runtime. 

The startup scripts for Microservices Runtime running in a Docker container now
set the internal environment variable correctly. 

PIE-70572 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Statistics Data Collector cannot delete all old data at one time.

When the Statistics Data Collector attempts to delete all old data in a single
execution, the attempt fails because it would require extending the undo
tablespace. 

To resolve this issue, Statistics Data Collector deletes old data in batches
using a scheduled system task that runs every 4 hours. (Note this is a JVM
system task, not an Integration Server system task). For every scheduled delete
task, Statistics Data Collector deletes the batches of data collected over a 4
hour period starting with the oldest data. The delete task performs batch
deletions every 30 seconds until all data older than the retention date is
removed. 

Note: The retention date is controlled by the retentionDays parameter in the
IntegrationServer_dir/instances/instanceName/config/monitor/monitor.cnf. 

PIE-71791 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
After upgrading to a new Cloud version, sometimes a flow service does not work
until it is resaved. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71912 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
An http request that follows a DELETE request fails with HTTP/1.1 400
[ISC.0064.9101] Bad Request. 

When Integration Server receives a DELETE request and the code handling the
request does not consume the entire request body, the remaining request body is
left in the input stream. When a subsequent request arrives on the same
connection, the request fails with the following error: HTTP/1.1 400
[ISC.0064.9101] Bad Request. The request is treated as invalid because the
leftover data from the DELETE request is used as the beginning of the subsequent
request. 

Now, Integration Server discards any unread data when it is done handling a
DELETE request. 

PIE-72160 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
A NullPointerException occurs when applying a configuration variables template
to a new or containerized instance of Microservices Runtime. 

When Microservices Runtime applies a configuration variables template that
creates new assets to a new instance or a containerized instance, Microservices
Runtime first checks whether a certain configuration file already exists before
creating new asset. The configuration check fails with a FileNotFoundException
because the subdirectory under /config that Microservices Runtimes checks for
does not yet exist. 

This issue is now resolved. Configuration checks now account for new or
containerized instances where subdirectories under /config might not yet exist. 

PIE-72221 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Attempt to create a Universal Messaging connection alias using configuration
variables fails with a NullPointerException. 

When Microservices Runtime attempts to create a Universal Messaging connection
alias through application of a configuration variables template, the attempt
fails with a NullPointerException if the template does not include username and
password. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71231 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server does not map the JSON request body of REST APIs to the input 
signature of the corresponding service.

If the request body of a legacy REST API has a JSON array at the root level, 
Integration Server does not map the request parameters to the input signature
of the corresponding service.

This issue is resolved now.

PIE-71244 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
The statistics log does not contain column names after the log rotates.

The column names appear in the first statistics log created upon Integration
Server start up. However, after the statistics log rotates, the column names are
missing. This occurs regardless of the format of the statistics log (.log or
.csv). 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71825 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server Administrator displays an alert about a search request
failure and there is no data in the dashboard. 

If the Statistics Data Collector attempts to recover from an error during a
restart, a StackOverFlowError occurs and prevents the Statistics Data Collector
from recovering. Integration Server Administrator displays the following alert: 

[ISS.0030.0385] Search request failed. Details: [ISS.0045.0152] The Statistics
Data Collector status is CLOSING. It is not able to complete the search
operation at this time 

This issue is now resolved by eliminating the recovery upon restart of the
Statistics Data Collector. If Statistics Data Collector is restarting, the
recovery is not necessary. 

PIE-71872 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
Updates to webMethods Metering for enabling metering based on the license key.

PIE-72273 (IS_10.11_Core_Fix1)
When migrating an Integration Server instance from 10.7 or above to a later
version, the monitor.cnf file is not migrated. 

The monitor.cnf, which was added in 10.7, contains configuration for the
Statistics Data Collector and is located at
\IntegrationServer\instances\<instanceName>\config\monitor. When migrating from
Integration Server 10.7 to a later version, the monitor.cnf is not migrated. 

This issue is now resolved.
