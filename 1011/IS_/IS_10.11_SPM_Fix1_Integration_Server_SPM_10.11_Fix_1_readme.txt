PIE-68030
Updates to packages deployed on a cloud environment are not visible. 

When packages and configuration assets for an existing solution are deployed to 
a cloud environment through Designer, the changes are not displayed in the 
cloud environment as the deployment fails intermittently. However, Designer 
does not display the status of the deployment, which is misleading. 

This issue is now resolved by including additional deployment logs to explain 
the cause.

PIE-71790
Changes to the Command Central for setting the password when creating a new
instance. 

The screen for creating a new Integration Server instance via Command Central
has the following changes: 

- The value for the Password for Administrator user field is now masked.
- The option to require the user to change the Administrator password on initial
log in now displays the list of possible values Yes and No. Previously, this
field was a check box and the result of selecting/clearing the check box was not
obvious. 
- The tool tip messages for the fields now indicate the correct default values.

PIE-72589
When Platform Manager and Integration Server run together, executing the 
command to stop Integration Server terminates Platform Manager instead. 

When Platform Manager is started as a Windows application using start-up 
scripts, executing the command on the Command Central CLI to stop Integration 
Server terminates Platform Manager instead of Integration Server, which 
continues to run despite executing the stop command. However, this issue does 
not occur when Platform Manager runs as a Windows service. 

The issue is resolved now.

PIE-75029
Adding or updating MWS roles to an Integration Server ACL through Command
Central 
results in an exception.

Adding or updating the "Allowed" or "Denied" list of an ACL with MWS roles
through the Command Central user interface or the CLI results in the
"Allow or Deny Group names are not valid." exception.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-75462
Command Central cannot connect to the IP address configured in the 
"watt.server.inetaddress" parameter in Integration Server. 

In Integration Server Administrator, when the watt.server.inetaddress is set to 
an IP address on which Integration Server listens to incoming requests, the 
server is not visible on Command Central. 

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-77197
Migration log is not visible on the Command Central Jobs page.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77316
When the Command Central web interface is used to create an Integration 
Server instance, no properties are displayed on the user interface.

This issue is resolved now.

PIE-77625
In Command Central, clicking the Overview or Configuration tab for the Monitor 
component in "Home > Instances > ALL > [instance_name] > Monitor" incorrectly 
throws the "Unexpected component status" although the Monitor component is 
online. 

This issue is now resolved.
