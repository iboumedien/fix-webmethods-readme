PIE-80727 (IS_10.11_EmbeddedDB_Fix4)
Database components in Integration Server fail to work after migrating
Integration Server from 10.3 to 10.11.

When migrating Integration Server from 10.3 to 10.11, the embedded database is
not updated with new tables. Hence, the database components fail to work.

The issue is resolved now.

PIE-77794 (IS_10.11_EmbeddedDB_Fix3)
The wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID scheduled service creates infinite
logs. 

The character length of cloud container hostnames exceed the size of the
RUNNINGON column in the database, which causes the infinite logs. 

The issue is resolved. Now, the column size is increased to support such cloud
container hostnames. 

PIE-79708 (IS_10.11_EmbeddedDB_Fix3)
When migrating the database from an earlier version to 10.11, PostgreSQL throws 
the "DB migration error: path not found" error message. 
 
A discrepancy in the DB migration directory name causes PostgreSQL to throw the 
"DB migration error: path not found" error message when migrating the database 
from an earlier version to 10.11. 
 
The issue is resolved now.
