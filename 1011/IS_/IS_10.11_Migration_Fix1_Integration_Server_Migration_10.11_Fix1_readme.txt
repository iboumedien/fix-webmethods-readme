PIE-74746
After migrating to an Integration Server to which a fix containing PIE-67747 has
been applied, the password of a cloned live database configured for a JDBC
connection pool alias is incorrect. 
 
When migrating an Integration Server instance, users can choose to use a clone
of the live database for the JDBC connection pool alias associated with a JDBC
functional alias. If two or more JDBC connection pool aliases exist, the
migration utility prompts for the password for one JDBC connection pool alias
but not for any of the other JDBC pool aliases. As a result, the migrate.dat
file prepared by the migration utility does not contain the password for the
JDBC connection pool. The migrated Integration Server instance cannot connect to
all of the databases. 

To resolve this issue, when the user opts to use a clone of the live database
for the JDBC connection pool, the migration utility prompts for the password for
all JDBC connection pool aliases. Furthermore, the migration utility saves the
encoded password in the migrate.dat file by default. 

However, saving the encoded password in the migrate.dat file represents a
security vulnerability. The new server configuration parameter
watt.migrate.hidePassword controls whether an encoded database password for a
JDBC connection pool alias will be saved in migrate.dat. Set
watt.migrate.hidePassword to false in the migrate.bat/sh file on the target
Integration Server for the migration utility to save the encoded database
password. Set to true to omit database passwords for JDBC connection pool
aliases from the migrate.dat file. The default is false. Set the
watt.migrate.hidePassword value on the target Integration Server before running
the migration utility. 

Example of setting watt.migrate.hidePassword in migrate.bat:

%JAVA_EXE% -Dwatt.migrate.hidePassword=true
-Dwatt.migrate.product.dataProvider=com.wm.app.b2b.server.migrate.MigratorAppDataProviderImpl
-Dwatt.installer.migrate.destDir="%IS_DIR%"
-Dcom.webmethods.sc.config.configRoot="%IS_DIR%\config"
-DCDBS.home.path=%DB_DIR% -Djava.library.path="%SSO_DIR%" -ms%JAVA_MIN_MEM%
-mx%JAVA_MAX_MEM% -classpath %CLASSPATH%
com.wm.app.b2b.server.migrate.cmd.IntegrationServerCmdLineToolMigrationDriver %* 

Example of setting watt.migrate.hidePassword in migrate.sh:

$JAVA_RUN $JAVA_D64 -Dwatt.migrate.hidePassword=true
-Dwatt.migrate.product.dataProvider=com.wm.app.b2b.server.migrate.MigratorAppDataProviderImpl
-Dwatt.installer.migrate.destDir=$IS_DIR -Dcom.web
