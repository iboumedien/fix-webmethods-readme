7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-74347
Integration Server logs the "unique constraint IDX_SVC_MINMAX_CTX violated"
error intermittently due to a race condition under high load.

The issue is now resolved.

PIE-80228
Migrating database components in PostgreSQL 14.5 from an earlier
version to Integration Server 10.15 fails.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-82644
Migrating the DistributedLocking component in PostgreSQL from an earlier
version to Integration Server 10.11 is unsuccessful.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-86011
Migrating the Archive component in Integration Server from a lower version
to a higher version results in the error: "Cannot drop the trigger
'WMSERVICE_RAIU', because it does not exist"

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81060 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix4)
In Cloud Container, database migration fails when migrating components from 10.5
to 10.7. 

This issue is resolved now.

WMN-8101 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix4)
When webMethods Monitor uses a Microsoft SQL Server database and there is a race
condition during services execution, an error message appears in the server.log
file: 
"Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.WMSERVICE_MIN_MAX' with unique
index 'IDX_SVC_MINMAX_CTX'." 

The issue is resolved.

PIE-77408 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix3)
The "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID" service causes 
performance degradation in databases while deleting large data sets.

Integration Server uses wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID to 
remove the expired entries from the WM_IDR_MSG_HST table. 
However, in some databases, wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID degrades the
database performance while deleting large data sets. 

This issue is resolved.
Now, Integration server provides an option to remove the expired 
entries in batches and to configure the batch size. To limit the 
batch size, use the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit server
configuration parameter. If you set the parameter value to a 
positive integer, Integration Server uses the value to apply a 
batching logic to remove the entries. If you are not providing 
any value, Integration Server retains the old behavior. There is no 
default value for the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit 
parameter. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for 
changes to this parameter to take effect. 

PIE-77794 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix3)
The wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID scheduled service creates infinite
logs. 

The character length of cloud container hostnames exceed the size of the
RUNNINGON column in the database, which causes the infinite logs. 

The issue is resolved. Now, the column size is increased to support such cloud
container hostnames. 

PIE-78146 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix3)
When using a SQL Server database, the pub.storage:get service occasionally
encounters a deadlock error. 

The distributed locking table WM_EXCL_DIST_LOCK has a redundant unique index on
its primary key. The unique index is not needed as primary keys are inherently
unique. Presence of the redundant index increases the likelihood that a deadlock
error will occur. 

To resolve this issue, a database migration script has been added to drop the
redundant index. 

PIE-79708 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix3)
When migrating the database from an earlier version to 10.11, PostgreSQL throws 
the "DB migration error: path not found" error message. 
 
A discrepancy in the DB migration directory name causes PostgreSQL to throw the 
"DB migration error: path not found" error message when migrating the database 
from an earlier version to 10.11. 
 
The issue is resolved now.

PIE-76966 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix2)
The IS_OAUTH_SCOPE.SCOPE_DESCRIPTION is missing when migrating from Integration 
Server 10.5 to 10.11 when the original Integration Server version is 9.12. 

If an Integration Server originally running version 9.12 was migrated to 
IS_10.5_Core_Fix1 with IS_10.5_EmbeddedDB_Fix1 and then migrated to version 
10.11, the SCOPE_DESCRIPTION column is not added to the IS_OAUTH_SCOPE table. 
Integration Server logs a SQLSyntaxError at startup and Integration Server 
cannot use OAuth. 

This issue is now resolved. The SCOPE_DESCRIPTION column is now added to the 
IS_OAUTH_SCOPE table.

PIE-74343 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
A java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException occurs because the REQUIRE_PKCE column is
not added to the IS_OAUTH_CLIENTS table in DB2.

After applying a fix that includes PIE-71960, which introduces the ability to
require PKCE per OAuth client, Integration Server dynamically adds the
REQUIRE_PKCE column to the IS_OAUTH_CLIENTS table when the server starts. This
modification to the IS_OAUTH_CLIENTS table fails for DB2, resulting in a
java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException.

This has been resolved by moving the database table modification for OAuth out
of Integration Server and into separate SQL scripts that can be executed by the
Software AG Database Component Configurator.

Important! To complete resolution of PIE-74343, you must install fix 4
IS_10.11_Database_Fix1 (and higher) and run the Software AG 
Database Component Configurator before starting Integration Server.

PIE-71412 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
Creating tables for the ISInternal component on a MySQL 8.0 database throws
"Specified key was too long; max key length is 3072 bytes".

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71617 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
For the ISCoreAudit component, the unique index on contextid column in
WMSERVICE_MIN_MAX table is missing in MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL databases.

Now, this issue is resolved. The unique index on contextid column in
WMSERVICE_MIN_MAX table is created for all the database types Integration
Server supports.

PIE-74000 (IS_10.11_Database_Fix1)
Upgrading Integration Server from 10.5 to 10.7 fails with "path not found for
10.5.fix3 MYSQL to 10.7".

While upgrading Integration Server, database schema migration from 10.5 to 10.7
throws "path not found for 10.5.fix3 MYSQL to 10.7" for MySQL databases. This
issue occurs while upgrading Integration Server from 10.5 to 10.11 as well.

This issue is now resolved.
