"/usr/lib64", "/usr/lib", "/lib64" and/or "/lib"!

8.0 Installation

Install using Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at 
http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(Linux only) If not done already, either install all Software AG products below "/opt/softwareag"
or create a symbolic link at "/opt/softwareag" pointing to the actual installation directory.

(Linux only) Some products might still setup the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH and append
the system's standard paths "/usr/lib64", "/usr/lib", "/lib64" and/or "/lib". They usually do this
via a script ending on "env" and residing in the product's INSTALL/-directory, e.g.
/opt/softwareag/EntireX/INSTALL/exxenv_, /opt/softwareag/AdabasClient/INSTALL/aclenv_, etc. These
lines have to be edited and the system's standard paths need to be removed.
Example before editing:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${acllibpath}:/lib64:/usr/lib64
Example after editing:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${acllibpath}

*Please note*, these changes are only necessary on Linux systems when either the system's tools or
Software AG products cannot be started and fail to resolve symbols from the OpenSSL libraries. The
changes should not be made on other systems!



9.0 Uninstallation

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.

Uninstall using Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at 
http://documentation.softwareag.com.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods product suite and
includes support for operation in any country, locale, or language as specified in the Installing
webMethods Products guide. It was not tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data.
This fix may have some globalization impact.


10.1 Localization


This fix does not require an updated language pack. It might contain new messages and these
messages will appear in English.
