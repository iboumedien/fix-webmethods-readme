The watt property watt.adapter.JDBC.setBooleanAsBitString enables the adapter to
process 0 and 1 as boolean value false and true respectively in the following
conditions:
1. In stored procedure adapter services where JDBC Type is BOOLEAN, and Input
Field Type is java.lang.String
2. In adapter services where JDBC Type is BIT, and Input Field Type or Output
Field Type is java.lang.String

JDB-3372 (JDBC_10.3_Fix14)

instances/<instance_name>/WmJDBCAdapter/code/jars.
The Default Driver Group represents the JDBC driver JARs located in the folder
Integration Server_directory/instances/<instance_name>/WmJDBCAdapter/code/jars.
You must create a new folder in Integration Server_directory/instances/
<instance_name>/WmJDBCAdapter/code/jars and copy the JDBC driver JARs to this
folder, to create a new Driver Group.

with data direct driver.

This issue is now resolved.

JDB-2951 (JDBC_10.3_Fix13)
The webMethods Adapter for JDBC now supports parallel asset initialization. Add
