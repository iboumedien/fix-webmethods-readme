Error while saving an application leads to creating a duplicate application.
When you edit an application and save it in the API Gateway UI, and an error
occurs while saving the operation to the API Gateway server, the application
remains in Edit mode in the UI. On clicking Save again creates a duplicate of
the application.

This issue is resolved.


YAI-39900 (YAI_10.11_Fix31)

Extending a global policy filter does not work.

In an API Gateway cluster a global policy is activated and hence affects a 
certain number of APIs. The global policy is now updated with a filter
'ApiName NotEquals' which means that after the update the global policy affects 
less number of APIs. In the API Gateway UI the global policy update terminates 
successfully. When you inspect the global policy and the affected APIs in 
the UI, in particular the APIs that are no longer affected after the update
because they match the 'ApiName NotEquals' filter, everything looks good. When 
you issue REST or SOAP calls against the cluster node that performed the global 
policy update for those APIs that are no longer affected by the global policy 
the calls behave as expected. However, when the same REST or SOAP calls are 
issued against one of the other cluster nodes, it is observed that the policy 
actions defined by the global policies are still applied to the APIs that match 
the 'ApiName NotEquals' filter.

The issue is resolved.


YAI-39762 (YAI_10.11_Fix30)

policy might get deactivated.

This issue is resolved


YAI-39445 (YAI_10.11_Fix30)

JMS/AMQP REST routing fails with JNDI alias for queues/topics.

When working with JMS/AMQP REST routing for an API, if the JNDI alias is used to
look up queues and topics, it does not work. However, when the queue name is 
provided directly as the destination name, it works fine.

This issue is resolved.


YAI-39055 (YAI_10.11_Fix30)

Error while downloading API Details documentation.
While downloading the documentation files from the API Details section, API
Gateway displays an invalid error.

This issue is resolved. API Gateway displays the correct error message when the
swagger file is invalid.


YAI-39814 (YAI_10.11_Fix30)

Providing a timeout for invoking backend REST APIs in addition to the existing 
connect and read timeout.

An additional timeout property, Native Service Timeout is introduced.
This property specifies the time interval (in seconds) after which an HTTP
connection attempt when calling the Integration Server HTTP
backend service pub.client:http for REST APIs times out.
For details about this property see the API Gateway User's guide.

This new feature is implemented.
The Native Service Timeout requires IS 10.11 Core Fix 19.
You can also use it with IS 10.11 Core Fix 18 with a special hot fix.


YAI-39350 (YAI_10.11_Fix30)

Deployment of OAuth2 clients from CentraSite is enhanced.

The deployment of OAuth2 clients from CentraSite is improved in 2 areas:
1. On deploy the values are completely setup. It is not necessary to regenerate,
which means client IDs and secrets are in line with the CentraSite values.
2. On a redeploy or update from CentraSite the OAuth2 values are no longer
changed or overwritten. This means that changes on OAuth2 values can only be
performed with API Gateway methods.


YAI-39161 (YAI_10.11_Fix29)

API Gateway UI displays wrong and missing information in API mashup screen.

At times, especially when accessing the API mashup screen for the first time,
it is observed that the API mashups are displayed incorrectly. For example,

This issue is resolved.


YAI-38681 (YAI_10.11_Fix29)

When multiple requests to create a new OAuth token 
("invoke/pub.apigateway.oauth2/getAccessToken") run in parallel for an extended
period in a Terracotta cluster, the server.log shows "Lock timed out" error 
messages. As a result, you must restart some or all nodes in the cluster.

This issue is resolved.


YAI-38724 (YAI_10.11_Fix29)

whether the OpenAPI syntax must be validated before importing the OpenAPI 
file.


YAI-38835 (YAI_10.11_Fix29)

When a SOAP native service returns an error with a result payload, API Gateway 
does not send the response payload if the 'Send Native Provider Response' flag 
is enabled.

This issue is resolved.

API Gateway UI, it is rejected with an "Invalid keystore" error.
However, the same keystore file imports successfully if you change the suffix 
to .p12. 

This issue is resolved.


YAI-38877 (YAI_10.11_Fix29)

IAM policy with SSL certificate fails when using X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header

When sending an SSL certificate as an HTTP header with an IAM policy, the policy 
does not work if the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert (XFCC) header value is provided in 
the following formats:

"Cert=-------BEGIN%20CERTIFICATE…"
"Hash=xxxx;Cert=-------BEGIN%20CERTIFICATE…"

This issue is resolved.

During startup, the API Gateway server.log displays an Apache Ignite warning. 
The following message appears with a severity level of "warning":

Class "com.softwareag.pg.pgmen.collectors.MacMap" cannot be serialized using 
BinaryMarshaller because it either implements Externalizable interface or have 
writeObject/readObject methods. OptimizedMarshaller will be used instead and 
class instances will be deserialized on the server. Please ensure that all nodes 
have this class in classpath. To enable binary serialization either implement
Binarylizable interface or set explicit serializer using 
BinaryTypeConfiguration.setSerializer() method.

This issue is resolved.

was not imported.

This issue is resolved. API Gateway now adds the default package "WmRoot" 
if the "pkg" property is missing. In other error cases, the import fails with an 
appropriate error message.

YAI-38468 (Fix 28)

Thread information is displayed as zero for Ignite cluster.
The following server information is displayed as zero for Ignite clusters:

When importing an archive with a URL alias and there is an existing API
available on API Gateway that uses the same alias value as custom gateway
endpoint URL, the import does not fail, but the custom gateway endpoint of the
API gets removed.

This issue is resolved. Now the import of the URL alias fails with an error
message: URL Alias is used as Gateway endpoint for API <api name>.

In a HAFT setup OAuth tokens are not synchronized between nodes.
When a node of the Cross-DC ring is actually a cluster of API Gateway servers
then some servers in the cluster can be in green data center health status,
while the other servers are in red status. If a new OAuth token is generated
by a red status API Gateway then the token is not synchronized with the
other nodes in the Cross-DC ring.

This issue is resolved.
The data center health status is now synchronized within an API Gateway cluster.

Native provider fault management does not work as expected with API Gateway and
Microgateway.
When using API Gateway with Microgateway wherein API Gateway endpoint calls
are routed to Microgateway, in an error situation, the native provider fault
does not work as expected.
If the sendNativeProviderFault property is set to true in API Gateway, all API
calls must respond with the native service error text in an error situation.
Also, if an API is configured with a Conditional Error Processing Policy that
uses the setting Send Native Provider Fault Message, the API must always respond
with the native service error text in an error situation.
This behavior is not observed in all situations.

This issue is resolved.

API Gateway starts partially with a JsonMappingException error.

API Gateway startup fails, and the server.log contains a JsonMappingException
"String length (5046272) exceeds the maximum length (5000000)".

This issue is resolved.
To avoid the JsonMappingException configure API Gateway with a larger value for
the JSON maximum string length. To achieve this, set the 'jsonMaxStringLength'
Java system property in the <sag_inst>/profiles/IS_default/configuration
/custom_wrapper.conf file. For example,
"wrapper.java.additional.1100=-DjsonMaxStringLength=15000000".
Alternatively, you can configure the JSON maximum string length by setting the
'jsonMaxStringLength' environment variable in the <sag_inst>/profiles/
IS_default/bin/custom_setenv.sh file (or custom_setenv.bat under Windows).
For example, "export jsonMaxStringLength=15000000" or
"set jsonMaxStringLength=15000000" for Windows.

If a similar error occurs as follows, "The incoming YAML document exceeds the
limit: 3145728 code points.", then you must configure the YAML code point limit
with the "yamlCodepointLimit" Java system property or environment variable, in
the same way as described above.

When the Validate API Specification policy is applied, the headers specified
in the API definition are not used for validating the requests and responses.
Users are mandated to specify headers in the policy and that is used in
validating the requests and responses.

This issue is resolved. API Gateway now uses the headers provided in the open
API specification when there are no headers provided in the Policy
specification tab. If headers are provided in the Policy specification tab
as well as the open API specification, then API Gateway uses the headers from
the policy specification tab.

Virtual OData API returns a HTTP 200 response, even if the request is
unauthenticated.
When accessing the OData API with its endpoint in API Gateway, it returns a
HTTP 200 response, even if the request is unauthenticated, although
Identification & authorize policy is activated and effective. This happens as
API Gateway stores the OData API document together with the API. However, it
might happen that real data gets stored instead of the metadata.

This issue is resolved. The OData API must be newly imported to resolve the
problem.

YAI-26974 (Fix 15)

A SOAP WSDL with nested schema is observed to generate different IDs for
subschemas.
On importing a SOAP API that has a WSDL with nested schema, it is observed to
generate different IDs for subschemas. This happens as a WSDL access with all
its referencing schemas is usually divided into multiple requests. However, when
the requests are distributed to different cluster members, through a load
balancer, the requests might fail.

This issue is resolved.

Error message appears when native service sends unzipped response.
When API Gateway is unable to process a request and does not send the request 
to the native service the same has to be communicated to the client. If those  
responses are in the gzip format, then an exception occurs when API Gateway 
tries to unzip those responses. If such responses are not in the gzip format, 
then API Gateway forwards them to the client as if the response header does not
contain the 'accept-encoding' variable.

indexes by replacing the tenant name and added to target index aliases as 
read-only indexes.

Response for a REST transformation enabled SOAP API is not proper.

When the native API is sending a SOAP response that has blank spaces, then
API Gateway transforms the blank spaces to JSON objects when performing the REST
conversion.

The issue is resolved. A new pg property, pg.soapToRest.removeWhitespaces, if
set to true, then allows you to specify whether the empty lines between SOAP
responses must be removed before performing the REST transformation. The value
is true by default.

Improvements to APIGateway Utility operations.

When you do not specify the tenant name and repoName parameters while running
apigatewayUtil scripts, 'list backup' command lists the snapshots from
'default' repo. Whereas, 'create backup' and 'restore backup' commands pick
the repo from 'pg.gateway.elasticsearch.tenantId' property located at
packages\WmAPIGateway\config\resources\elasticsearch\config.properties.

This issue is resolved now by changing the operations of few apigatewayUtil
commands like 'list backup', 'rollover', and so on to pick the repo property
from 'config.properties' file when none of the parameters like tenant name or
repoName are specified.
