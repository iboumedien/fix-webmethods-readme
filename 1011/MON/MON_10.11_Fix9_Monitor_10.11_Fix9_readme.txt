1.0 Fix Name

webMethods Monitor 10.11 Fix 9 (WmMonitor package update)



2.0 Fix ID

MON_10.11_Fix9



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects webMethods Monitor 10.11.



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

Optimize 10.11 Fix 9 or higher is required. Optimize fixes contain updates to shared components,
used by both Monitor and Optimize products, so Optimize optimizeSharedLib 10.11 Fix 6 should be installed even if
Optimize is not present on the machine.

such as Designer, Process Engine, Optimize and ESB, and Business Console.

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section of the Software AG Empower Product
Support website at https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp



5.0 Platform Support

This fix is supported on all platforms supported by webMethods Monitor.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. For RGHWPE-4389 PostgreSQL database support for Monitor.
Set Default archiving parameter in the OPERATION_PARAMETER table:
        PostgreSQL: Process Audit Log schema name

2. BPM Archival for PostgreSQL database only supports multiple schemas with single db only.
For E.g:

CREATE DATABASE bpmarchive(db name);
 \c bpmarchive;(connect to database)

CREATE SCHEMA processbpm(process schema name);
SET search_path TO processbpm;

-- create user now --
CREATE USER processbpmuser (process schema user);
ALTER USER processbpmuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'manage';
ALTER USER processbpmuser SET search_path = processbpm;

--grant permissions --
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE bpmarchive TO processbpmuser;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA processbpm TO processbpmuser;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA processbpm TO processbpmuser;
--below grants are needed to make sure if user creates new objects in future , grants are
available for them too
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON FUNCTIONS TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON TYPES TO processbpmuser;

--create archive schema now --
CREATE SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm(archive schema name);
SET search_path TO archiveprocessbpm;

-- create user now --
CREATE USER archiveprocessbpmuser(archive schema user) ;

7.0 Fix Contents

WMN-8671
In the Process Instance page of webMethods Monitor, the Resubmit Closest button does not resubmit a process instance in which the failed step is contained in a subprocess.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8475(MON_10.11_Fix8)
In webMethods Monitor, the My webMethods Server settings might override the Task Client settings.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8362(MON_10.11_Fix8)
In webMethods Monitor, several API queries consume a lot of memory.

The issue is resolved. The following services are modified so that the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter in monitor.cnf applies to them.

pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceList
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListWithFilter
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomDataSet
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomData
pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList

If you set useExactMatch to True, your search query will return only those INSTANCEID,
PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID results which exactly match your search term. An isExactMatch input parameter is also added to these services. isExactMatch works like the useExactMatch parameter, but takes priority over it.

New parameter reference:
  isExactMatch
  
  This parameter allows you to control whether your search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  
Valid values are:
  false - Default value for isExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  true - If you set isExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID. The query will return only those
  results which exactly match your search term.


WMN-8418(MON_10.11_Fix7)
In the About the Integration Server Administrator page, when you click Get diagnostics, errors appear in the server.log file.

The issue is resolved.

With webMethods Monitor the Step Details Error section displays a unexpected exception.

This issue is resolved.

WMN-8267(MON_10.11_Fix6)
In webMethods Monitor, when you assign an Integration Server host name using the watt.server.scheduler.logical.hostname property, multiple imageCleanup tasks are scheduled after each Integration Server restart. 

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8275(MON_10.11_Fix6)
In webMethods Monitor, when you assign an Integration Server host name using the watt.server.scheduler.logical.hostname property, multiple imageCleanup tasks are scheduled after each Integration Server restart. 

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8291(MON_10.11_Fix6)
In webMethods Monitor, when you stop a process instance during an active subprocess step, the subprocess continues executing and an error is displayed. 

The issue is resolved.

log contains a warning message.


WMN-8058(MON_10.11_Fix2)
In webMethods Monitor, after you restart Integration Server, the Scheduler page displays a number of scheduled tasks with 
the imageCleanup service.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7958(MON_10.11_Fix2)
In webMethods Monitor, when you terminate an Oracle Database archive service and start a new service, a message for 
a successful operation appears, but no data is archived.

The issue is resolved. To archive data, grant SELECT privilege to the Archive User:
1. Install the MON_10.11_Database_Fix3 fix.
2. Open Oracle Database and log in as a SYS user.
3. Execute the "GRANT SELECT ON V_$SESSION TO <archive_user>;" SQL procedure, where <archive_user> is the user used to 
log in to the Archive database.

WMN-7953(MON_10.11_Fix1)
With webMethods Monitor, search query performance needs to be improved.

The issue is resolved. To improve search query performance on an SQL Server database configured in Integration Server,
the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter is added to the monitor.cnf configuration file.

New parameter reference:
  useExactMatch

  This parameter allows you to control whether a search by keyword query performed from the
  Process Instance Detail page will use the UPPER and LIKE functions for instanceID and
  parentinstanceID.

Valid values are:
  false - Default value for useExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID.
  true - If you set useExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID. The search query will return only those results
  which exactly match your search term.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7997(MON_10.11_Fix1)
With webMethods Monitor, when you open a process details page in Business Console, the Summary tab does not display process
instance details. The issue occurs when Integration Server and My webMethods Server use a MySQL 5 database.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7975(MON_10.11_Fix1)
With webMethods Monitor, when the Integration Server host is part of a stateless cluster environment with a shared database,
pub.monitor:imageCleanup might not start.

The issue is now resolved.

WMN-7846(MON_10.11_Fix1)
With webMethods Monitor, the getInstanceListWithFilter service fails when the logged field contains "and" in the name.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7845(MON_10.11_Fix1)
With webMethods Monitor, the getStepDetails service returns the input pipeline regardless of the status specified 
in the service inputs. In addition, the audit timestamp returned by the getStepDetails service is incorrect for the 
requested status.

The issue is resolved. The optional input parameter stepInputPipeline has been added to the getStepDetails service.

New parameter reference:
  stepInputPipeline

Valid values are:
  false - When stepInputPipeline is set to false, all data
  returned by the getStepDetails service is specific to the
  requested status.
  true - Default value for stepInputPipeline. When
  stepInputPipeline is set to true, the getStepDetails service
  returns the input pipeline with the correct audit timestamp.

WMN-7841(MON_10.11_Fix1)
With webMethods Monitor, resubmitting one or more process instances from the process list might fail with an error. 
This issue occurs when executing the "Resubmit Closest" or "Rebsubmit Earliest" actions.
