1.0 Fix Name

webMethods Optimize OBECentConfCdc 10.11.0 Fix 10



2.0 Fix ID

OPT_10.11_Fix10


3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects:

- Analytic Engine 10.11


4.0 Requirements

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section
of the Software AG Empower Product Support website at
https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp

For Optimize environments, the fix version of the Optimize component fixes must
be the same as the fix version of Optimize shared components fixes
(wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedLib and wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedUI).


5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.


6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Attempting to apply the Optimize Fix to an installation where
 MWS is configured to use the embedded Derby database will fail.
 There will be an error reported in the Software AG Update Manager
 log. For all other supported Relational Database Management Systems
 configured for MWS, the fix can be applied successfully.

 There is no workaround at this time.


 2. Software AG does not recommend uninstalling this fix because 
 Optimize or other webMethods products might not work properly.

 To be able to restore your Optimize installation, before you install
 the fix you must back up the Optimize database and your file system.


7.0 Fix Contents


OBE-12648 (OPT_10.11_Fix10)
In webMethods Optimize, you cannot set a new value for the service.address parameter in the GlueServiceRegistryProperties.xml file.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8671 (OPT_10.11_Fix10)
In the Process Instance page of webMethods Monitor, the Resubmit Closest button does not resubmit a process instance in which the failed step is contained in a subprocess.

The issue is resolved.



WMN-8475 (OPT_10.11_Fix9)
In webMethods Monitor, the My webMethods Server settings might override the Task Client settings.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8362 (OPT_10.11_Fix9)
In webMethods Monitor, several API queries consume a lot of memory.

The issue is resolved. The following services are modified so that the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter in monitor.cnf applies to them.

pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceList
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListWithFilter
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomDataSet
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomData
pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList

If you set useExactMatch to True, your search query will return only those INSTANCEID,
PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID results which exactly match your search term. An isExactMatch input parameter is also added to these services. isExactMatch works like the useExactMatch parameter, but takes priority over it.

New parameter reference:
  isExactMatch
  
  This parameter allows you to control whether your search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  
Valid values are:
  false - Default value for isExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  true - If you set isExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID. The query will return only those
  results which exactly match your search term.



OBE-12549 (OPT_10.11_Fix8)

WMN-7958 (OPT_10.11_Fix3)
In webMethods Monitor, when you terminate an Oracle Database archive service and start a new service, a message for a successful operation appears, but no data is archived.

New parameter reference:
  useExactMatch

  This parameter allows you to control whether a search by keyword query performed from the
  Process Instance Detail page will use the UPPER and LIKE functions for instanceID and
  parentinstanceID.

Valid values are:
  false - Default value for useExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID.
  true - If you set useExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID. The search query will return only those results
  which exactly match your search term.


OBE-12109 (OPT_10.11_Fix2)
Analytic Engine does not start in an Optimize environment that has a Universal Messaging cluster.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7841 (OPT_10.11_Fix2)
