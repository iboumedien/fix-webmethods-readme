CHS-205 (Chem_7-1_Fix13)
In IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1, Chem transactions are failing and messages 
are not sent to the trading partner.

The module cannot connect to the trading partner if CA Root certificate is not
configured on the host Integration Server.

This issue is resolved. Now, the module can connect to the trading partner even
if CA Root certificate is not configured on the host Integration Server.


CHS-193(Chem_7-1_Fix12)
Incorrect ExternalID extracted from the sender profile by Chem eStandards
Module.

Chem eStandards Module always extracts the first ExternalID of the  senderï¿½s
profile instead of extracting the correct ExternalID from the senderï¿½s
profile.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-183(Chem_7-1_Fix11)
To improve performance, Chem eStandards Module stores trading partner and
agreement related information, and some information related to inbound and
outbound message processing in Oracle Coherence ecache.

With Integration Server 8.2 SP2, IBM webMethods Chem eStandards Module 7.1 is
supported for use with Terracotta and Ehcache technologies. As of Integration
Server 8.2 SP2, both Oracle Coherence and Terracotta are supported as caching
and clustering solutions. The steps to configure which solution you want to use
vary according to whether you are using Chem eStandards Module in a clustered
or non-clustered Integration Server environment.

In Integration Server 8.2 SP2, Terracotta Ehcache is the default caching
solution. If you are currently using Coherence caching and want to continue
using Coherence, you must explicitly define it.

Caching Without Clustering
To choose your caching solution, complete the following steps:
1. In Integration Server Administrator, select Settings > Extended.
2. Click "Edit Extended Settings."
3. Specify Coherence or Terracotta Ehcache as the caching solution by typing
one of the following:
   watt.server.cluster.cacheType=coherence or
   watt.server.cluster.cacheType=ehcache
4. Click "Save Changes."

Integration Server updates the watt.server.cluster.cacheType property in the
server.cnf file in the <Integration_Server_directory>\config\ directory.

Caching With Clustering
To choose the caching with clustering solution, complete the following steps:
1. In Integration Server Administrator, select Settings > Clustering.
2. Click "Edit Cluster Settings."
3. Click "Enable Cluster."
4. Select the Cache Type as "Coherence" or "Terracotta."
5. Enter the values as appropriate in the other fields.
6. Click "Save Settings."

Integration Server updates the watt.server.cluster.cacheType property in the
server.cnf file in the <Integration_Server_directory>\config\ directory.

The "Time to Live" parameter in the "Cache Configuration" controls the amount
of time an entry can remain in the cache before Chem eStandards Module removes
it. The default value for this parameter is "172800 seconds" (approximately two
days). Consequently, transactions that run longer than two days may be
adversely affected. It is recommended that you change this value to
reflect your longer running transactions.

For complete information about configuring Ehcache on Integration Server, see
Administering webMethods Integration Server. For complete information about
clustering, see Integration Server Clustering Guide.

CHS-176 (CHEM_7-1_Fix10)
The process model templates provided with IBM webMethods Chem eStandards Module 
7.1 are not working as expected since the release of webMethods 8.2.

The latest release of webMethods 8.2 modified the underlying libraries that the
Chem eStandards Module process model templates use. As a result, the process
models are no longer completing as designed.

This issue is resolved. Process model templates now reflect the changes
introduced by webMethods 8.2. Updated templates are located in the
\packages\WmChem\ProcessModels\ folder, ending with the name, "_8x."

CHS-173 (CHEM_7-1_Fix10)
In Chem Module, the links for "PIP Import" and "Sample Import" are not working
as expected for the webMethods 8.2 release.

The method of storing data for selection boxes on DSP pages was modified in the
latest release of webMethods 8.2. When the user makes a single selection of a
.par file or a sample file, the import fails without returning an error.

This issue is resolved. Chem Module now reflects the changes resulting from
webMethods 8.2. The links for importing files work again, as intended.

CHS-148 (Chem_7.1_Fix9)
Failure of Chem transactions on IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 that uses the
webMethods 8.0 suite.

When Chem transactions are running on IBM webMethods Chem 7.1 Module that uses 
the webMethods 8.0 suite, the process models fail with the 
com.wm.app.prt.ProcessException exception.

This issue is now resolved. To successfully run IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 
on the webMethods 8.0 suite, do the following:

1. After you install this fix, in the Integration Server Administrator page, in
Extended Settings, set the following property:

   watt.core.schema.validateIncomingXSDUsingXerces=false

   This property allows you to import the required PARs so that Chem eStandards
Module can work with the webMethods 8.0 suite.

2. Install the sample file "Chem 7.1 Create Order 8x Sample.zip"  to have the
latest samples to use with Chem eStandards Module    on webMethods 8.0. The
sample files are available on the Empower Web site.

Note: If Chem Module is installed on the webMethods 7.x.x versions, you do not
need to complete the steps listed above. For Chem eStandards Module to run on
webMethods 8.0, you must install Chem eStandards Module 7.1 Fix 9 or higher.

CHS-121 (was 1-1Z1SO0) (Chem_7-1_Fix8)
Incorrect DOCTYPE tag in the payload of RNIF messages.

The DOCTYPE tag in the payload of RNIF messages contains an invalid character
"@version" instead of the payload document root tag, for example, <!DOCTYPE
@version SYSTEM "abc.dtd">.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-120 (was 1-1YA9C1) (Chem_7-1_Fix8)
The inbound validation of Chem Module transactions fail with an error message
when the external ID of the partner exceeds 9 characters.

The error message is as follows: <FreeFormText>
com.wm.estd.chemical.rnif11.mime. RNIF11ValidationException: Found a header at
ServiceHeader: ServiceHeader/ProcessControl/
ProcessIdentity/initiatingPartner/GlobalBusinessIdentifier; with invalid
length. The invalid header value in the incoming stream is: ;604793278D&#39;.
Valid length is between: 9 - 9. </FreeFormText></reason>

The validation fails because, as per the RNIF specifications, the DUNS external
ID must be of 9 character length.

This issue is resolved. The new parameter
"RosettaNet.disableGlobalBusinessIdentifier.validation" defines whether Chem
Module must validate the service header for external IDs or not. You set the
parameter as follows:

- To enable the validation of Service Header, set the parameter as:
RosettaNet.disableGlobalBusinessIdentifier.validation=false

- To disable the validation of Service Header, set the parameter as:
RosettaNet.disableGlobalBusinessIdentifier.validation=true

CHS-114 (was 1-1WA305) (Chem_7-1_Fix7)
In a clustered environment, process models fail while trying to send the
receipt acknowledgement.

In a clustered environment, the information required to generate the receipt
acknowledgement is not appropriately shared across the cluster nodes. Due to
this, the generation of the receipt acknowledgement fails, resulting in the
failure of the process models.

This issue is resolved. Now, the cache shared across the cluster nodes is
updated correctly and the information is shared appropriately.

CHS-116 (was 1-1X7KEA) (Chem_7-1_Fix7)
Sending and receiving documents between partners fails when IBM webMethods Chem
Module 7.1 participates in a hub scenario for document exchange.

In a hub scenario for document exchange one partner acts as the hub or mediator
for sending and receiving documents. When Chem Module participates in a
document exchange between Partners A, B, and C, where Partner A acts as the
hub, the partners are unable to send or receive documents. When the hub
(Partner A) sends a document to the fulfiller (Partner B) impersonating the
sender (Partner C), Chem Module fails to recognize the response from the
fulfiller (Partner B). The issue occurs because the initiator (Partner A) is
different from the receiver (Partner C) and the ConversationID assigned to the
response document is not associated with the running process instance.

The issue is resolved. Chem Module 7.1 associates the response document with
the running process instance by generating the correct ConversationID. When
Chem Module is part of a hub scenario, in the config file located at
IntegrationServer\packages\WmChem, set the property RosettaNet.isHub=true. The
default value for this property is false.

CHS-115 (was 1-1WT9DN) (Chem_7-1_Fix7)
In Chem eStandards Module 7.1, there are multiple issues with validation and
exception handling for RNIF 1.1.

When validating RNIF 1.1 documents, Chem eStandards Module 7.1 does not handle
exceptions properly.

This issue is resolved. Chem eStandards Module 7.1 now uses strict data
validation and has improved exception handling.

CHS-72 (was 1-1S85ZJ) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
Errors are thrown when executing the pub.estd.chem:migrate service.

While executing the pub.estd.chem:migrate service during IBM webMethods Chem 
Module migration, errors indicating that the service is unknown are thrown. This
happens because of incorrect service mapping.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-95 (was 1-1TJIH7) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
Sending an acknowledgement to a partner fails with a null pointer exception.

This issue occurs only while sending an acknowledgment for documents that were
received successfully.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-101 (was 1-1UM8IN) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
When using IBM webMethods Chem eStandards Module, the value of the
VersionIdentifier field in the ReceiptAcknowledgement service header is
incorrect.

The VersionIdentifier field value must be the version number of the message
guideline of the business action. However, the value is incorrectly displayed
as the version of RNIF.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-102 (was 1-1UM8OW) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
The receipt acknowledgment that Chem eStandards Module generates contains both
ActionControl and SignalControl sections in the service header.

According to the Chem standards, Chem eStandards Module must generate only
SignalControl section in the receipt acknowledgment service header.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-103 (was 1-1UM8RQ) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
In the ReceiptAcknowledgement service header, the field,
GlobalPartnerRoleClassificationCode, contains an incorrect value.

The GlobalPartnerRoleClassificationCode field must contain the OrderResponse
value.

This issue is now resolved.

CHS-104 (was 1-1UMAVN) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
The FreeFormText field is not available in the ReceiptAcknowledgement
implementation.

The FreeFormText field is available in Chem eStandards Module 6.0.1, however it
is not available in Chem eStandards Module 7.1.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-105 (was 1-1UMAWY) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
In ReceiptAcknowledgement, the CommunicationsNumber element is blank.

The CommunicationsNumber element must pick the value that you provide in the
Telephone field in the Contacts tab. You provide the value in the Telephone
field when defining the partner profile.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-106 (was 1-1UMB2I) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
In ReceiptAcknowledgement, the EmailAddress element is blank.

The EmailAddress element must pick the value that you provide in the email
field in the Contacts tab. You provide the value in the email field when
defining the partner profile.

This issue is now resolved.

CHS-107 (was 1-1UPKA1) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
Incorrect value in the GlobalDigestAlgorithmCode field of
ReceiptAcknowledgement.

The value in the GlobalDigestAlgorithmCode field must be SHA1 instead the value
is SHA-1.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-108 (was 1-1UPKB8) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
Incorrect value in the GlobalPartnerClassificationCode field of the
ReceiptAcknowledgement.

The value of the GlobalPartnerClassificationCode field in
ReceiptAcknowledgement must be picked from the OrderCreate or OrderResponse
transaction. However, these values are picked from the TPA that has incorrect
values.

This issue is resolved. In the TPA, update the SenderClassification and
ReceiverClassification with the correct values.

CHS-109 (was 1-1UPKBV) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
In ReceiptAcknowledgement, the GlobalPartnerClassificationCode element value
appears blank.

Even after providing the required values in SenderClassification and
ReceiverClassification fields in the TPA, the GlobalPartnerClassificationCode
element value appears blank.

This issue is resolved.

CHS-110 (was 1-1UPKCE) (Chem_7-1_Fix6)
GlobalSupplyChainCode element does not get populated with the default value.

In ReceiptAcknowledgement, if the value of the element, GlobalSupplyChainCode,
is blank, then it must automatically be populated with the default value.
However, the element continues to remain blank.

This issue is resolved. Now, when the GlobalSupplyChainCode element is blank,
it is automatically populated with the default value "Electronic Components."

CHS-94 (was 1-1T29LE) (Chem_7-1_Fix5)
In IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1, the business document does not get dropped 
after the document processing completes.

When the pub.estd.chem:processDocument service is invoked, the processDocument
service does not drop the business document after processing is complete. The
wm.ip.cm:processDocument service of Chem Module 6.0.1 always drops the business
document after processing.

This issue is resolved. The business document is now dropped by the service
pub.estd.chem:processDocument after processing is complete.

CHS-75 (was 1-1SMGNZ) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
Activity Messages for IBM webMethods Chem Module are not displayed on My 
webMethods Server 7.1.

My webMethods Server 7.1 does not display the Activity Messages for Chem
Module, whereas My webMethods Server 6.0.1 displays the Activity Log
information for Chem Module.

This issue is resolved. The My webMethods Server 7.1 Activity Messages section
contains the Chem Module messages.

CHS-77 (was 1-1SN8GZ) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
Service wm.ip.chem:receive in IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 sends response 
status of HTTP 202 where Chem Module 6.0.1 sends response status of HTTP 200.

When a Trading Partner posts a document to the wm.ip.chem:receive service, Chem
Module responds with an HTTP status code. In Chem Module 6.0.1, the service
returned code HTTP 200 (which indicates a successful response from the server).
But in Chem Module 7.1, the service returns code HTTP 202, which is used for
asynchronous messages and indicates that a message has been received, but
processing is not complete. Some customers recognize code HTTP 202 as an
unacceptable response because processing could still result in the document
being rejected based on content.

This issue is resolved. The service wm.ip.chem:receive, which is deprecated in
IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1, now correctly sends status code HTTP 200. Also, 
the service pub.estd.chem:receive, replaces the deprecated service sends the 
status code HTTP 200.

CHS-78 (was 1-1SRRXC) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 audit log does not display the HTTP Status Code.

HTTP Status Code for any outbound document can be either 200 (for a successful
delivery) or 400 (for an error during delivery) according to RNIF11
Specifications. This status code is not displayed in the audit log of Chem
Module 7.1.

This issue is resolved. Chem Module 7.1 now displays the HTTP Status Code that
it recieves from the trading partner, in the audit log.

CHS-79 (was 1-1SRRY4) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 returns incorrect tags for Receipt 
Acknowledgement.

After initiating a Create Order process, the Receipt Acknowledgement
information displayed on Trading Networks Console displays incorrect tags, that
is two tags in the form of <from> <Role> and <To><Role> instead of a
corresponding single tag <fromRole> and <ToRole>. Also, the structure of the
XML tags is not maintained in the acknowledgement.

This issue is resolved. Chem Module 7.1 now sends the tags as <fromRole> and
<ToRole> for Receipt Acknowledgement on Trading Networks Console. The structure
of the XML tags is also maintained.

CHS-80 (was 1-1SRRYM) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
Communication fails between Trading Partners when using IBM webMethods Chem 
Module 7.1.

The header information of Chem Module 7.1 messages comprises Message-ID,
MIME-Version, Content-ID (only for RNIF 2.0 specifications), and RNSubType. For
outbound messages, the values of Message-ID and MIME-Version are null. Also
Content-ID which must not be available for RNIF11 specifications, is available
in the header information and RNSubType which is expected to be listed before
Content-Description, is listed after Content- Description.

The issue is resolved. Message-ID and MIME-Version are not null and are
consistent with the Chem Module 6.0.1 setup. Content-ID does not exist and
RNSubType is listed before Content- Description.

CHS-82 (was 1-1SYIXC) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
When IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 is running in a clustered
environment, the transactions that involve multiple nodes fail.

The data stored for Process Engine is not available to other Integration Server
nodes in a cluster. As this data is not available across all the nodes, the
transactions that involve more than one node will fail.

This issue is resolved. Chem Module 7.1 uses shared cache to store the common
Process Engine data required for a Chem transaction. Other Integration Server
nodes can now access the Process Engine data from the shared cache and all the
transactions in a process model are completed successfully.

CHS-90 (was 1-1T0DC1) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
In IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1, the value of GlobalBusinessIdentifier tag in 
the <ToRole> of outbound Receipt Acknowledgement does not display the correct
information.

Chem Module 7.1 was sending the GlobalBusinessIdentifier information of the
Sender in the <ToRole> of Receipt Acknowledgement instead of the Receiver
information.

This issue is resolved. Chem Module 7.1 now sends the value of the
GlobalBusinessIdentifier of the Receiver in the <ToRole> tag of Receipt
Acknowledgement.

CHS-91 (was 1-1T0DCN) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 is unable to identify a
ReceiptAcknowledgementException document.

Chem Module 7.1 designates a process version of 1.1 for a
ReceiptAcknowledgement document and expects the same process version for a
ReceiptAcknowledgementException document as well. Since the process version was
not set for the ReceiptAcknowledgementException, Chem Module 7.1 is unable to
identify the ReceiptAcknowledgementException.

This issue is resolved. The process version of 1.1 is now set for the
ReceiptAcknowledgementException document and Chem Module 7.1 can identify the
ReceiptAcknowledgementException document.

CHS-92 (was 1-1T0DD8) (Chem_7-1_Fix4)
Outbound messages in IBM webMethods Chem Module 7.1 return corrupted data.

Outbound messages with special characters, undergo an internal conversion from
Input Stream to String and String to Input Stream using byte array. This
conversion was not using the "UTF-8" encoding. Therefore the conversion
returned corrupted data.

This issue is resolved. The internal conversion from Input Stream to String and
String to Input Stream using byte array now uses "UTF-8" encoding. All special
characters are now encoded and displayed correctly.

CHS-73 (was 1-1SAZ00) (Chem_7-1_Fix2)
The pub.estd.chem:processDocument service fails with a
com.wm.lang.xml.WMDocumentException.

If the value in any of the XML tags in a document that is passed to the
pub.estd.chem:processDocument service contains special characters (for example
&), the service fails and throws a com.wm.lang.xml.WMDocumentException in the
server log. This error occurs because the service does not correctly process
documents with values that contain special characters like & or <.

This issue is resolved. The pub.estd.chem:processDocument service correctly
processes documents with XML tag values that contain special characters.

CHS-145 (was 1-1SJI3R) (Chem_7-1_Fix2)
Sending non-valid outbound documents from IBM webMethods Chem Module fails even
though validation is turned off.

In the case where it is necessary to send non-valid documents to trading
partners, the ValidateOutput TPA parameter is set to No. When these documents
reach the Chem Module service for outbound processing, the service rejects the
document due to invalid values. This error occurs because the Chem Module is
validating the document even though validation is turned off.

This issue is resolved. IBM webMethods Chem Module now correctly validates 
outbound business documents based on the setting of the ValidateOutput parameter.

CHS-53 (was 1-1QQQH6) (Chem_7-1_Fix1)
Chem eStandards Module 6.0.1 is unable to exchange signed business documents
with Chem eStandards Module 7.1.

Due to an interoperability issue, the users of Chem eStandards Module 6.0.1 are
unable to exchange signed business documents with users of Chem eStandards
Module 7.1, whereas users of Chem eStandards Module 7.1 can exchange signed
business documents with users of Chem eStandards Module 6.0.1.

This issue is resolved. Chem eStandards Module 6.0.1 users can now exchange
signed business documents with Chem eStandards Module 7.1.
