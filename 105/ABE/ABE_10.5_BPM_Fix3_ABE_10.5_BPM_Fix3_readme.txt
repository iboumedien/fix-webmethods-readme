7.0 Fix Contents

ABE-242
Asset Build for BPM does not include process images.

Process model diagrams are only uploaded to the WMPROCESSIMAGE metadata table when the
model is built and uploaded directly from Designer. Process images files cannot be included
in the package.

The issue is resolved. You can now manually save the process diagram as a JPG and/or SVG
file and have the images included in the build artifact. The images must be located in the
same workspace as the .process file and must have the same name as the process for the
images to be included in the process build artifact.


WMDPD-9865
With webMethods Monitor, process diagrams cannot be manually saved.

The process diagram cannot be manually saved as a JPG and/or SVG file
and upload the images with the process metadata.

The issue is resolved. Support for manually exported images is now
included for the build and upload tool delivered with Designer, the
Asset Build Environment and Deployer.

DES_10.5_Deployer_Fix8, ABE_10.5_BPM_Fix3 and DES_10.5_Process_Fix6
should be installed together to resolve this issue.


ABE-255 (ABE_10.5_BPM_Fix2)
With webMethods Asset Build Environment, version 10.1 Fix 3 builds are incompatible
with version 9.7 process models.

The issue is resolved. 

WMDPD-9808 (ABE_10.5_BPM_Fix1)
An error might occur while performing a deployment simulation.

The issue is resolved.
