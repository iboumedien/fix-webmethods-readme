SPM-5356 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 14)
Installing fixes with Software AG Command Central might fail with an error.

When installing fixes over an HTTPS connection, Command Central fails to connect to 
Platform Manager. The issue occurs because of a defect in the JDK that Command Central uses.

The issue is resolved. The workaround described in the JDK-8160347 issue is now 
implemented in Command Central.


CCE-7040 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 12)

The dynamic configuration of Git repositories added in Command Central exposes clear text passwords.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central encrypts all passwords when adding a Git repository.
However, if you have added Git repositories in Command Central before installing this fix, you must
complete the following steps for each repository to make sure no clear text passwords are exposed:
1. Navigate to <Software AG_directory>\profiles\CCE\configuration\
com.softwareag.platform.config.propsloader and open the
"com.softwareag.repository.git.pid-<repository_name>.properties" file in a text editor.
2. Add "@secure." in front of each property name that has a password value. For example:
@secure.password=mypassword
3. Save the file.


CCE-6455 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 10)
In Command Central 10.5, when you supply invalid credentials for the master 
repository, or have not accepted the product license agreement, the connection 
to the repository fails, but the error message does not describe the error properly.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central now displays the following error message:
CCEREPE0050: Cannot connect to the repository
Explanation: The repository does not accept the credentials.
Action: Check if you have supplied valid credentials and accepted the license agreement 
for the specified credentials. The troubleshooting steps are described 
in the Command Central documentation. 


SUM-4413 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 9)
When install fixes with Software AG Command Central always latest fixes
are installed even if older fix versions are selected.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5965 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 8)
Installing Platform Manager using the zip archive bootstrapper file fails.

The issue is resolved. Now you successfully install Platform Manager using the zip archive
bootstrapper file. 


CCE-6200 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 8)
When using the Command Central CLI to create a fix mirror repository, if you specify a source
repository that is not registered in Command Central, the command fails with an exception. However,
the exception does not indicate the reason for the failure.

The issue is resolved. Now the exception message specifies that one of the provided source
repositories is not registered in Command Central. 


CCE-6187 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 8)
After executing database administration operations in Command Central, some of the messages logged
in the Platform Manager logs include the database password in clear text.

The issue is resolved. Now the database password is not included in clear text in the Platform
Manager logs.


CCE-6158 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 7)
When an SSH server is configured to terminate idle sessions and Command Central 
runs a long-running  operation on a remote machine, the SSH connection might 
terminate before the operation is completed. To keep the SSH connection open, 
you can set the following Java system property:
com.softwareag.platform.management.client.remoteaccess.keepaliveperiodsec=<time-interval-in-seconds>
Property reference:
Default: 0 – Indicates not to send keep-alive messages.
Description: The time interval in seconds between keep-alive messages send from the host server to 
the remote server. To send keep-alive messages, set a positive integer greater than zero. The 
keep-alive interval should be smaller than the terminate idle sessions interval, configured on the 
remote SSH server. For example, if the SSH server terminates idle sessions after 180 seconds, set 
the keep-alive property to 150 seconds.


WF-15615 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 7) 
In an infrastructure micro template or a composite template that you use to bootstrap Platform 
Manager on a remote machine, you can define:
-	a user that connects over SSH to the remote machine and copies the bootstrapper on the machine
-	a substitute user to install and start Platform Manager
To use a substitute user, you must consider the following requirements:
-	The remote machine must have a POSIX-compliant operating system. This function is not supported 
    on Windows operating systems.
-	The substitute user must have read permissions for the home directory of the SSH connection user.
-	The SSH user must have read permissions for the home directory of the substitute user. 
You can use the template with the substitute user to create new installations or migrate existing 
installations.

To define a substitute user, add the "substituteUserCredentials:" section in the 
nodes/default/default/bootstrapInfo section of the template. You can add the substitute user 
credentials as “userName:” and “password:” parameters or map the substitute user to a credentials 
alias, for example “substituteUserCredentials: ${subst.credentials.alias}”. The following example 
shows a sample template snippet with a “substituteUserCredentials:” section that includes
“userName:” and “password:” parameters:

environments:
  default:
    install.dir: /opt/softwareag
    bootstrapper: cc-def-10.5-milestone-lnxamd64.sh
    subst.username: substituteUser
    subst.password: substitutePass
    conn.username: SSHUser
    conn.password: SSHPass
...
nodes:
  default:
    default:
      port: 8093   # Default Platform Manager HTTPS port.
      secure: true # Indicates that the connection will be over SSL.
      bootstrapInfo:
        installDir: ${install.dir}  # The installation directory.
        installer: ${bootstrapper}  # Name of Command Central bootstrapper to use.
        substituteUserCredentials:  # Substitute user credentials. 
          userName: ${subst.username}
          password: ${subst.password}
        credentials:                # SSH connection credentials.
          userName: ${conn.username}
          password: ${conn.password}
...


CCE-6166 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 7)
In Command Central, after exporting a product instance, the generated run-time 
micro template has a product instance section for each run-time component listed 
in the “products:” section of the inline template. 
The behavior is incorrect, because the run-time micro template must have only 
one product instance section, generated for the exported product.

The issue is resolved. 
The generated run-time micro template now has only one product instance
section, generated for the exported product. 


CCE-5755 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 5)
Before, the uimetadata template section included only three attributes - 
displayName, data_type and isSecure. 
 
Now it can have a fourth attribute - format, to denote the date format 
in the case of data_type having the value 'datetime'.


CCE-5953 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 5)
After you register a Git asset repository in Command Central and run the 
"sagcc exec templates composite import assetRepoName" CLI command to import 
templates from the repository, the command fails with the following message:
"415 Unsupported Media Type"

The issue is resolved. 
Now you can successfully import templates from a Git asset repository.


CCE-5886 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 4)
If a database layer in a product stack maps to a node that is part of the 
default environment and one user-defined environment, the connection to 
the database fails. The behavior occurs because of a shared secret handling issue.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5816 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 4)
In Command Central, when executing a composite template, in some cases 
a child job applying an inline template might fail. The behavior occurs 
if the template fails to list the inline templates that are stored 
on the file system.

The issue is resolved. 
Now the templates always list all inline templates stored on the file system
and Command Central applies them successfully. 


CCE-5813 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 4)
When applying a template with “environment.mode=migration”, if a password 
property for a product instance has an encrypted value, Platform Manager 
does not decrypt the password and does not migrate the product instance successfully.

The issue is resolved. 
Now when migrating with a template, Platform Manager decrypts the encrypted
values of the password properties successfully. 


CCE-5877 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 4)
Migrating Command Central fails if the source custom_wrapper.conf file references 
a file that does not exist on the target installation.

The issue is resolved. 
Now Command Central tansforms and migrates the referenced file path even
when the file does not exist. 


CCE-5523 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 3)
The "artifacts" argument of the 'sagcc exec repository products export' 
command supports the "ALL" value, but the value is not documented 
in the Command Central Help and the CLI help.

The issue is resolved. 
The Command Central Help and CLI help for the 'sagcc exec repository products export' 
command are now updated to include "artifacts=ALL" as supported value.


CCE-5716 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 3)
In the Command Central web user interface, the Installations page might 
load slowly if the hosts of some installations are shut down or unknown.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central has been optimized to deal properly with hosts that are 
shut down or unknown, and the Installations page loads without delay.


CCE-5676 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 3)
If an instruction in a template generated by Command Central is longer 
than 128 characters, the instruction line starts with the "?" symbol. 
This behavior results in a valid, but less human-friendly YAML syntax.

The issue is resolved. 
The YAML syntax of long lines in a generated template 
is now uniform with the rest of the template.


CCE-5488 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 3)
Adding a new installation in Command Central takes a long time 
when the installation is not running.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5706 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 3)
When setting up the "com.softwareag.platform.management.client.template.composite.skip.restart.for"
server system property, you can now specify the run-time component IDs using a regular expression.
For example, if you specify:
"com.softwareag.platform.management.client.template.composite.skip.restart.for=TES-(.*)"
At the end of a template application, Command Central will not restart the run-time components,
which have an ID starting with "TES-". 


CCE-5491 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
In some cases, after you connect to the default templates repository on 
GitHub using the Command Central web user interface, the repository disappears, 
and the following error message is displayed when you navigate 
to the Repositories > Assets tab: “Internal Error processing the request.”

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5383 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, if you connect to the default templates 
repository on GitHub for the second time using the same repository name, 
all default templates imported into Command Central when you first 
connected to the repository get replaced with the latest templates on GitHub.

The issue is resolved. 
Now you see a notification that the default templates will be 
re-imported and you can choose to cancel the operation. 


CCE-5651 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
When you try to configure a layer definition that references a micro template 
that is not imported in Command Central, the layer definition gets created 
successfully. This behavior is incorrect.

The issue is now resolved. 
Command Central validates if the specified micro template is imported 
before creating a layer definition for the template.


CCE-5611 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
When exporting the product instance of a product that does not support 
instance management to a micro template, if you select to include only 
the instance properties, the inline template is generated without a 
product instance. As a result, Command Central will fail to create a 
layer that uses the layer type definition for the generated template, 
because it cannot associate the layer with a product instance.

The issue is resolved. 
Now the inline template in the generated micro template includes a product
instance and the name of the product instance is the run-time component ID 
of the exported product instance. 


CCE-5538 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, if the infrastructure 
layer definition that you use to create a new infrastructure layer 
has a "nodes" parameter with a variable, the layer does not have 
any run-time components.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central now registers OSGI-SPM as the infrastructure layer run-time. 


CCE-5484 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
The job description of the database action jobs has been streamlined. 


CCE-5380 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, the Installations page might 
load slowly if the hosts of some installations are shut down or unknown.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central has been optimized to deal properly with hosts that are 
shut down or unknown, and the Installations page loads without delay. 


CCE-5642 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 2)
When applying a template in migration mode, if a product instance section 
in the template includes the "install.service: true" property, 
Command Central does not pass the property to the product migration utility. 
As a result, you cannot indicate in the template whether to migrate a product
instance as a Windows service.

The issue is resolved. Now when the “install.service: true” instance property 
is included in thetemplate, Command Central passes the property to 
the product migration utility. 


CCE-5595 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 1)
When Command Central is migrated from older release and the source Command Central 
had nodes containing assets, the target Command Central is not operational 
due to corrupted cache.

The issue is now resolved. 

CCE-5379 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 1)
After refreshing the contents of a fix repository in the Command Central web user interface, 
it does not pick up fixes for operating systems you added in the product mirror repository, 
which you use for the fix mirror repository. For example, if you add a new OS in the product 
mirror repository, the fix mirror repository is not updated with the fixes for the OS you added.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central successfully refreshes the contents of a fix mirror repository with fixes for 
operating systems added in the product mirror repository used by the fix mirror repository. 

CCE-5557 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 1)
Log entries are missing after migrating Command Central.
After you migrate Command Central using the Command Central migration utility or the Command Central
bootstrap installer the SoftwareAG_directory/CommandCentral/install/logs/migrationLog log does not
have any log entries.

The issue is resolved. 

CCE-5489 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 1)
When you add the default templates from the repository on GitHub using the "Local templates ZIP file"
repository type in the wizard and browse to a local ZIP file of the default templates, Command
Central does not find and import the templates from the specified ZIP file.

The issue is resolved. 

CCE-5521 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 Fix 1)
In the Command Central web user interface, when you use the Install Product wizard to install
products on an existing node, it might not be possible to select an "Install from" repository even
when several product repositories are registered in Command Central.

The issue is resolved.
