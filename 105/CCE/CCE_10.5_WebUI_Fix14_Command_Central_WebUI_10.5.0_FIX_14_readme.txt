SUM-4413 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 10)
When installing fixes from the Command Central web user interface, the "Install Fixes" wizard
always shows the latest version of dependent fixes, even when a fix requires an old version of a
dependent fix.

The issue is now resolved. To view old fixes in the “Install Fixes” wizard, click Options and select
Show older fixes.


CCE-6201 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 8)
The Command Central web user interface does not indicate when you attempt to import an invalid
template. In Command Central, if you attempt to import an invalid template using the web user interface,
Command Central does not add the template in the Templates view but does not display a message
stating that the template was not imported.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central displays an error message indicating that the template
was not imported because it is invalid.


CCE-6142 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 8)
When you use the “Auto-select same as…” option in the Install Fixes wizard to update an installation
with the same fixes installed in another installation, the wizard shows the latest version of the
auto-selected fixes available in the fix repository. The behavior is an issue when you want to
update an installation with a fix with the exact same version as the fix installed in another
installation.

The issue is resolved. Now with the “Auto-select same as…” option, Command Central auto-selects
fixes as follows:
- If a fix with the exact same version is available in the fix repository, the wizard selects the fix with
the same version.
- If a fix with the same version is not in the repository, the wizard selects the latest version of the fix
instead and notifies the user. 


CCE-6212 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 8)
On the Fixes tab in the Command Central web user interface, when viewing the table of installed
fixes in an installation, you cannot sort the data in some of the columns in the table.

The issue is resolved. You can now sort the data in all table columns. 


CCE-6027 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 6)
When you use the “Auto-select same as…” option in the Install Fixes wizard 
to update an installation with the same fixes installed in another installation, 
the wizard shows the latest version of the auto-selected fixes available 
in the fix repository. The behavior is an issue when you want to update an 
installation with a fix with the exact same version as the fix installed in another
installation.

The issue is resolved. 
Now with the “Auto-select same as…” option, Command Central auto-selects
fixes as follows:
- If a fix with the exact same version is available in the fix repository, 
the wizard selects the fix with the same version.
- If a fix with the same version is not in the repository, the wizard 
selects the latest version of the fix instead and notifies the user. 


CCE-6020 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 5)
When exporting a product instance to a template, Command Central fails to list the available
configuration types in the “Select Configuration Types” step of the “Export Instance to Template”
wizard if a child component of the selected product instance does not have any configuration
instances.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central successfully lists the configuration types when a
child component of the product instances has no configuration instances.


CCE-5825 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 4)
When exporting a product instance to a template, in the “Select Configuration Types” 
step of the “Export Instance to Template” wizard, Command Central does not list some 
of the configuration types for the child components of the selected product instance.

The issue is resolved. 
Now Command Central lists all configuration types for the product instance
and its child components in the wizard. 


CCE-5383 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, if you connect to the default templates 
repository on GitHub for the second time using the same repository name, 
all default templates imported into Command Central when you first 
connected to the repository get replaced with the latest templates on GitHub.

The issue is resolved. 
Now you see a notification that the default templates will be 
re-imported and you can choose to cancel the operation. 


CCE-5541 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
When connecting to a new asset repository, if you specify the name or location 
of an asset repository that is already registered in Command Central, 
the connection attempt fails with an error. Command Central also deletes 
the existing repository with the same name. The issue occurs because you 
cannot have two repositories registered under the same name, 
or using the same location.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-5643 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In the "Export Database to Template" wizard in Command Central, 
after you clear the "Use components latest version" checkbox, 
move onto the "Summary" step and go back to the first wizard step, 
the checkbox is selected (in other words, it gets reverted to its default value).

The issue is now resolved. 
Command Central keeps the changes you made to all input fields and checkboxes, 
even when you go back and forward in the "Export Database to Template" wizard. 


CCE-5512 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In some cases when deploying assets to Integration Cloud, the “Restart Required” 
KPI is displayed when you are viewing instances in the Command Central web user 
interface. This KPI is only used for monitoring run-time components 
with pending changes that require restart.

This issue is resolved. 
The “Restart Required” KPI is no longer displayed in the Command Central web
user interface. 


CCE-5471 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
When you open several layers from different stacks in the Stacks view, 
the Command Central web user interface starts to respond slowly.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5372 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
Run-time component configurations are not visible in the Command Central 
web user interface. If a run-time component has a large number of configurations, 
some configurations might not be visible and accessible in the 
configurations drop-down box for that component.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5684 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In the Export Instance to Template wizard, after you choose to export a 
product instance without configurations, the Select Configuration Types 
step of the wizard might still ask you to select which configurations to export.

The issue is resolved. 
Now when you choose to export an instance without configurations, the Select
Configuration Types step indicates that Command Central 
will not export configurations.


CCE-5617 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, if you navigate from the Stacks 
view to another view (excluding the Installations view), and from there onto 
the Installations view, all instance statuses are displayed as unknown 
until Command Central executes a status refresh.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5608 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In Command Central, when viewing the contents of a product repository, 
it is hard to read the product IDs in the "Product ID" column, because 
the column is too narrow and you can only widen it manually.

The issue is now resolved. 
By default the "Product ID" column is wide enough to read the product IDs.


CCE-5412 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, you cannot add layers to a stack 
if the name of the stack contains a period (.)

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5380 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, the Installations page might 
load slowly if the hosts of some installations are shut down or unknown.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central has been optimized to deal properly with hosts that are 
shut down or unknown, and the Installations page loads without delay. 


CCE-5524 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, when a plain text configuration includes 
the "\n" characters, Command Central treats “\n” as code for end-of-line and moves 
the text after it on a new line. For example, if the configuration has:
"user:"company.com\new"=operator"
Command Central displays it as:
"user:"company.com
ew"=operator"

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-5490 (Software AG Command Central 10.5 WebUI Fix 1)
The messages and tooltips in the dialogue boxes for connecting to and updating 
the default templates repository on GitHub are updated to provide more information.
