4.0 Requirements

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section
of the Software AG Empower Product Support website at
https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp

For Optimize environments, the fix version of the Optimize component fixes must
be the same as the fix version of Optimize shared components fixes
(wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedLib and wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedUI).

Same platforms as product release.


6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Attempting to apply the Optimize Fix to an installation where
 MWS is configured to use the embedded Derby database will fail.
 There will be an error reported in the Software AG Update Manager
 log. For all other supported Relational Database Management Systems
 configured for MWS, the fix can be applied successfully.

 There is no workaround at this time.


 2. You cannot uninstall this fix using Software AG Update Manager.

 To be able to restore your Optimize installation, before you install
 the fix you must back up the Optimize database and your file system.

With Optimize Analytic Engine, using user passwords that are encrypted in Command Central fails.

In Command Central, you cannot edit the SNMPAlert Settings and the WSAction Settings for Analytic 
Engine.

Analytic Engine, the changes are saved in the wrong location. As a result, Analytic Engine continues 
to use the old settings.

The issue is resolved.

You cannot view the password of an Optimize database pool in Command Central.

In Command Central, the Databases configuration type page for Optimize Analytic Engine might not

configured using the Central Configurator in My webMethods.

The issue is resolved.
