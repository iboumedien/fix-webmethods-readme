1.0 Fix Name

webMethods Optimize OBECentConfCdc 10.5.0 Fix 15



2.0 Fix ID

OPT_10.5_Fix15


3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects:

- Analytic Engine 10.5


4.0 Requirements

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section
of the Software AG Empower Product Support website at
https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp

For Optimize environments, the fix version of the Optimize component fixes must
be the same as the fix version of Optimize shared components fixes
(wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedLib and wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedUI).


5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.


6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Attempting to apply the Optimize Fix to an installation where
 MWS is configured to use the embedded Derby database will fail.
 There will be an error reported in the Software AG Update Manager
 log. For all other supported Relational Database Management Systems
 configured for MWS, the fix can be applied successfully.

 There is no workaround at this time.


 2. You cannot uninstall this fix using Software AG Update Manager.

 To be able to restore your Optimize installation, before you install
 the fix you must back up the Optimize database and your file system.

webMethods Optimize uses an older version of the Bouncy Castle Crypto package, which has known security vulernabilities.

The issue is resolved. webMethods Optimize now uses Bouncy Castle Crypto 1.69.



OBE-11987 (OPT_10.5_Fix14)
During fix installation, OPT_10.5_Fix12 extracts the latest database SQL scripts in incorrect directory locations. This may cause failures when you create or migrate databases using Database Component Configurator.

WMN-7754 (OPT_10.5_Fix12)
"With webMethods Monitor, search query performance needs to be improved.

The issue is resolved. To improve search query performance on a MySQL database configured in Integration Server, the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter is added to the monitor.cnf configuration file.

New parameter reference:
  useExactMatch

  This parameter allows you to control whether a search by keyword query performed from the
  Process Instance Detail page will use the UPPER and LIKE functions for instanceID and
  parentinstanceID.

Valid values are:
  false - Default value for useExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID.
  true - If you set useExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID. The search query will return only those results
  which exactly match your search term."

WMN-7668 (OPT_10.5_Fix12)
With WebMethod Monitor, performance of the pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList
service needs to be improved.

The issue is resolved. A new parameter, isExactMatch, is added to improve the service performance.

New parameter reference:
isExactMatch
This parameter is used to specify whether the query uses UPPER and LIKE function for instance ID.
Valid values are:
- true - the query will not use UPPER and LIKE function for instanceID.
Complete instanceID needs to be provided for the query to function properly.
- false (default) - the query uses UPPER and LIKE function for instanceID.

This issue is resolved.

OBE-11829 (OPT_10.5_Fix12)
In an Optimize environment, Analytic Engine begins to use a lot of memory and CPU resources whenever process/step control data cannot be processed. This results in degraded performance which might lead to a potential crash.

The issue is resolved.

OBE-11958 (OPT_10.5_Fix12)
In an Optimize environment, creating a database for MySQL 8 CE using Database Component Configurator fails.

The issue is resolved.

OBE-11763 (OPT_10.5_Fix9)
Optimize fills up the dead letter queue with unprocessed JMS messages.

Optimize might fail to process some JMS messages and might send them to the dead letter queue. As a 
result, the dead letter queue might fill with JMS messages. The issue occurs when the JMS message is 
longer than the maximum allowed length.
To disable publishing EDA process_model events, please add the following line to wrapper.conf file:
wrapper.java.additional.41=-Dpublish.process.meta=false

The issue is resolved.

OBE-11743 (OPT_10.5_Fix9)
Process tracker could not process controll operations.

Optimize violates -watt.server.http.X-Content-Type-Options=nosniff 

In an Optimize environment, when you configure the "-watt.server.http.X-Content-Type-Options=" header to "nosniff", the configuration
page is displayed incorrectly and you cannot submit new data in some of the user interface fields.

The issue is resolved.

OBE-11704 (OPT_10.5_Fix9)
Analytic Engine and Web Service Data Collector cannot run behind a load balancer.

The issue is resolved. You can enable Analytic Engine or Web Service Data Collector to work behind a load balancer, by doing the following:
1. Install the OPT_10.5_Fix9 fix.
2. Open the EndpointRegistry.xml file located in:
For Analytic Engine: <sag_install_dir>/optimize/analysis/conf/system/
For Web Service Data Collector: <sag_install_dir>/optimize/dataCollector/conf/system/
3. Add a new endpoint for the load balancer configuration to each EndpointRegistry.xml file you want to modify:
<endpoint host="HOSTNAME" name="LB Registry" path="PATH" port="PORT" protocol="PROTOCOL"/>, where:
<host> is the IP address or hostname of the load balancer.
For the <name> parameter, specify "LB Registry".
<path> is the routing path for the listener.
<port> is the port on which to access the load balancer.
<protocol> is the communication protocol to use with the load balancer, for example HTTP or HTTPS.

Important: You must perform the above steps after each deployment of an environment configuration from the user interface, because the EndpointRegistry.xml file is overwritten.



OBE-11652 (OPT_10.5_Fix8)
Sometimes Analytic Engine does not recover properly after a
database session timeout. This causes repeating error messages to
appear in the Optimize log files.

The issue is resolved.

OBE-11655 (OPT_10.5_Fix8)

You might not be able to select Broker Server as a logical server in your
Optimize environment.

On the Design Servers tab in the Edit Environment page in My webMethods, when
you click Add to select a logical server, Optimize shows an incomplete list of
the supported versions of Broker Server. As a result, you might not be able to
add a Broker Server to the environment.

The issue is resolved.

process instance.

On the Analytics page in the Business Console, when you click the process instance ID to access the
