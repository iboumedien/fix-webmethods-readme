After a restart, API Gateway resets the access mode of a port from 'Allow' to
'Deny'.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-31680 (Fix 41)
useJSSE parameters for ports are not applicable anymore.

This issue is resolved. As Integration Server has dropped the support of the
parameter useJSSE with PIE-72765, it is now also no longer supported by
API Gateway and therefore removed from the API Gateway UI.

YAI-32096 (Fix 41)
Discriminator does not work as expected.

API Schema validation fails to work as expected when enabled with the defined
discriminator at the schema level.

This issue is resolved. The discriminator concept is introduced in the open API.

validated.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-29914 (Fix 38)
Outbound proxy passwords are corrupted.

The passwords of outbound proxies are found to be corrupted after installation
of API Gateway 10.11 fix 20. All outbound communication through the proxy fails.
While the API Gateway is up and running it is possible to correct the password
from the administration UI. However, after the next restart of the API Gateway
the password is again corrupted. The corrupted password sent to the outbound
proxy has the value "********************************".

This issue is resolved.

YAI-30098 (Fxi 38)
API Gateway logs display JsonMappingException error.

When working with larger json files, API Gateway log files display errors such
as JsonMappingException: String length (20054016) exceeds the maximum
length (20000000).

This issue is resolved.
In API Gateway, the maximum string length for json is now increased to
2,147,483,64 and the watt property 'watt.server.json.decode.maxStringLength' is
set to this maximum value at startup. 

YAI-28653 (Fix 37)
Security vulnerability identified in third party component,
snakeyaml-1.33.0.jar.

To enhance the security, the third party component, 'snakeyaml-1.33.0.jar' is
upgraded to a safer version.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-29750 (Fix 37)
Continuous increase in memory leakage on using validate schema.

During the runtime invocations, the usage of Validate API Specification policy 
causes memory leakage and performance degradation. 

This issue is resolved.

YAI-28277 (Fix 36)
SOAP API activation dialog box does not accommodate long custom endpoints.

If you have defined long custom endpoints for SOAP API and when you try to
activate it, the activation dialog box displays only half of the endpoint.

This issue is resolved by accommodating long endpoints within the activation
dialog box.

YAI-29342 (Fix 36)
Security vulnerability identified in third party packages.

To enhance the security, the following third party packages are removed:
WmAPIGateway/cli/lib/spring-web-5.3.23.jar,
WmAPIGateway/code/jars/static/json-20211205.0.0.jar

This issue is resolved.

YAI-29286 (Fix 36)
API Gateway starts partially with a JsonMappingException error.

API Gateway startup fails, and the server.log contains a JsonMappingException
"String length (5046272) exceeds the maximum length (5000000)".

This issue is resolved.
To avoid the JsonMappingException configure API Gateway with a larger value for
the JSON maximum string length. To achieve this, set the 'jsonMaxStringLength'
Java system property in the <sag_inst>/profiles/IS_default/configuration
/custom_wrapper.conf file. For example,
"wrapper.java.additional.1100=-DjsonMaxStringLength=15000000".
Alternatively, you can configure the JSON maximum string length by setting the
'jsonMaxStringLength' environment variable in the <sag_inst>/profiles/
IS_default/bin/custom_setenv.sh file (or custom_setenv.bat under Windows).
For example, "export jsonMaxStringLength=15000000" or
"set jsonMaxStringLength=15000000" for Windows.

If a similar error occurs as follows, "The incoming YAML document exceeds the
limit: 3145728 code points.", then you must configure the YAML code point limit
with the "yamlCodepointLimit" Java system property or environment variable, in
the same way as described above.

YAI-29162 (Fix 36)
API Gateway health endpoint returns yellow status intermittently.

When multiple health endpoint calls are made in parallel the returned status can
be yellow. At the same time, the diskspace, memory, and servicethread fields are
empty.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-27891 (Fix 35)
Unable to perform search using the '_aggregations' endpoint.

When you perform a search using the '/rest/apigateway/search/_aggregations' 
endpoint, and if the key values you provide has a upper case character, then 
the search does not return valid response.

This issue is now resolved.

YAI-27988 (Fix 35)
If you generate a sample JSON input of a REST-enabled SOAP service for an
array element, then a string type element is generated instead of an array
element.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-27446 (Fix 35)
API zip file includes the native WS policy

In contrast to the WSDL loaded in the browser with the API Gateway endpoint, 
the WSDL packed in the API zip file contains the native WS policy incorrectly.

The issue is resolved.

YAI-28564 (Fix 35)

This issue is resolved.

YAI-28487 (Fix 35)
When an API is using two global policies and you deactivate one global policy,
it is observed that the second global policy does not work.

When an API is using two global policies and you deactivate one global policy,
then the other other global policy stops working. This might happen if one
global policy is defining Traffic Optizmization policy and the other is defining
a Monitor SLA or Monitor Performance policy.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-28385 (Fix 35)
The internal API, exchangeidtoken, does not work as expected.

When you invoke the internal API, exchangeidtoken with JWT as a bearer token,
then the access token is not sent to the client.

The issue is resolved.

YAI-28036 (Fix 34)
API Mocking with condition to check integer field returns empty response.

When the integer data in the API request body is matched with mocking condition,
the response payload is empty.

YAI-28072 (Fix 33)
Importing an inactive global policy does not disable the policy.

When an active global policy is overwritten by an import of an inactive version
of it, this policy is shown as inactive in the API Gateway UI. But the policy
is still active when service requests are made on APIs that are using it.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-27071 (Fix 33)
Performance issues observed when changing global polices for many APIs.

YAI-26222 (Fix 32)
API invocation fails with an error message 'HTTP/1.1 400 The endpoint reference
EPR) for the Operation not found.'

When a WSDL contains multiple bindings with different operations, then after
activation all bindings are activated although only one binding can be used.
During activation, API Gateway UI selects one endpoint and the selected endpoint
is activated. Invoking the API with the other endpoints fails with an error.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-27329 (Fix 32)
API mocking conditions with XPath expressions for SOAP requests do not work,

API mocking conditions with XPath expressions for SOAP requests do not work
when the request contains xml payload as input and the XPath has a
namespace prefix.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-23631 (Fix 24)

Query parameters forwarded to custom extension by default.

When you add a custom extension policy to an API, the query parameters that are
sent by the client to the API are passed to the custom extension even when the
"forwardQueryParams" extended setting is disabled. This behavior is observed
with the APIs that are part of the API Mashups also.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-23522 (Fix 24)

The Column with the type 'timestamp' is missing in the 'AGW_EVENT_AUDITLOGS'
table.

API Gateway creates the following table 'AGW_EVENT_AUDITLOGS' to store the audit
logs. Since the Column with type 'timestamp' is missed in the table, the
partitioning of the table is not possible.

This issue is resolved by creating a new column 'EVENT_CREATE_TS' of type
'TIMESTAMP' in the 'AGW_EVENT_AUDITLOGS' table.

partially loaded. This happens only if the connection to Elasticsearch is
protected by SSL, for example, if the SearchGuard plugin is enabled in
Elasticsearch.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-24546 (Fix 24)

Response for a REST transformation enabled SOAP API is not proper.

When the native API is sending a SOAP response that has blank spaces, then
API Gateway transforms the blank spaces to JSON objects when performing the REST
conversion.

The issue is resolved. A new pg property, pg.soapToRest.removeWhitespaces, if
set to true, then allows you to specify whether the empty lines between SOAP
responses must be removed before performing the REST transformation. The value
is true by default.

YAI-24485 (Fix 24)

This issue is resolved.

YAI-19256 (Fix 23)
Unable to partially import an archive

When importing an archive into API Gateway, you can only import the complete
archive. It is not possible to import a defined number of assets. For example,
you cannot import a defined number of APIs.

The issue is resolved. 
You can define the assets to be imported in the same way as export. For more 
information, see the updated swagger file APIGatewayArchive.json,
located at SAGInstalldirectory/IntegrationServer/instances/default/packages/
WmAPIGateway/resources/apigatewayservices.

published correctly to API Portal.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-23526 (Fix 23)
XML schemas that are required for schema validation of APIs are not preloaded 
during the startup or deployment in Mediator. As a result, the first invocation
of APIs take longer duration.

This issue is resolved. The "pg.schema.cacheOnDeploy" extended setting is added 
to API Gateway from Mediator. The available options are:

True. If an API has the Validate API Specification policy with Schema enabled 
then the schema is loaded in the memory during API activation.
False. The schema is loaded during the first invocation of API.

The default value of this setting is false.

error. The API operations are back to normal once the active Terracotta
server is operational.

The issue is resolved.

YAI-23081 (Fix 17)
Insufficient API Gateway server logging

The error "Service not found" after the activation process is insufficient to
analyze the root cause of the error. The API Gateway server log does not provide
enough information to determine whether the desired API is activated properly
during the server startup.

The issue is resolved.

To Do

YAI-22902 (Fix 17)
Updation of existing API with Swagger file causes issues with runtime invocation
of that API.

When you update an existing API with a swagger file, the runtime invocation

To Do

YAI-21870 (Fix 17)
Asset Build Environment(ABE) fails to build API Gateway repository.

If your URL aliases name contain slashes '/', ABE fails to create the API
Gateway repository.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-20793 (Fix 17)
Non-preemptive authentication requests will be logged as INFO messages in server
log.

API Gateway does not create transactional/error events for non-preemptive 
authentication requests, i.e., requests sent without authentication information.
This is by design. To identify such non-preemptive authentication requests, a 
log will appear with the message ID "YAI.0102.0018I" in the server.log.

This issue is now resolved. A message will appear with the text 
"A non-preemptive authentication request has been made. Hence, this will not be 
logged as a transaction/error event."

YAI-19352 (Fix 17)
After partial imports, unassigned objects are installed on API Gateway.

When you import assets like APIs or applications without using the 'Overwrite'
flag and if the assets already exist, but if the new object has more
dependencies like policies, scopes, or strategies, then the import of the main
object fails, but the additional objects get imported and continue to exist in
API Gateway as orphaned artifacts.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-23079 (Fix 17)
Login Id of the user is case insensitive in APIGateway

It is possible to create a user with the same LoginId using different case 
letters in the Integration Server. It is case senstive. But APIGateway doesn't

The issue has been fixed. Case check validation relaxed now.

YAI-21480 (Fix 17)
Schema validation fails for a Soap API.

The XML schema validation for a SOAP API works well only when the schemas are
defined in the right order in the WSDL. When the order of the schemas is changed
in the WSDL, the schema validation fails.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22616 (Fix 17)
API key option is not removed from IAM of an API after deactivating the package

When you associate an API and a package and activate, the package adds new IAM 
policy with API key if IAM policy does not exist in the API. If IAM policy
exists, package changes logical condition to OR and adds API Key option to the 
IAM policy. If IAM policy exists and API Key is already selected in the policy, 
the package activation changes the logical operant to OR alone.
After the deactivating package, the IAM policy that exists in the API
does not revert to old behavior.

This issue is resolved. After deactivating the package, the changes done by the 
package are reverted if the API is associated to only one package, if it is
associated to multiple package the changes will be reverted after all the
packages are deactivated.

YAIC-3305 (Fix 16)
Null pointer exceptions occur during scope mapping verification.

When you delete an API, which is mapped to an OAuth scope, the OAuth token
validation fails with null pointer exceptions in selective nodes of the cluster
due to incorrect data synchronization.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22706 (Fix 16)

This issue is resolved. You can now invoke REST APIs and invoke the same as
flow service.

YAI-22510 (Fix 16)
When you create an API with an OpenAPI file, where a default value for a
parameter is defined, it is included in the OpenAPI/Swagger File from
the API Gateway. However, if no default value is defined for a parameter in the 
imported OpenAPI file, and if it is defined in the WebUI later, the default
value is not included in the newly created OpenAPI/Swagger file.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22398 (Fix 16)
Unable to send Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header in preflight CORS
response.

When you invoke an API with CORS policy enabled and if you have set the Allow
Credentials to true, API Gateway does not send the
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header in the preflight response.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22296 (Fix 16)
Unable to view failed application finder information in the server log.

When you invoke an API enforced with Identify & Authorize policy, server log
displays identified application information but it does not display failed
application finder information.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22237 (Fix 16)
It is possible to change the login id of an API Gateway user.

In API Gateway UI it is not possible to change the login id of a user as the
field is disabled. But the server allows changing the login id of a user.

The issue is resolved. Now validation is done on the server side as well.

YAI-22231 (Fix 16)
Custom policy with WebMethod IS service invocation throws generic error message.

When you use a WebMethod IS service invocation in custom policy, if the IS
service throws an exception with custom message, custom policy does not honor
and returns generic error message.

 
This issue is resolved. Now, the custom policy returns error message as returned
by InvokeESB policy. If there is any ServiceException or FlowException thrown
from IS service, it is propagated to the client. If IS service return any other
exception, a generic exception used in InvokeESB is returned to client.

YAI-21802 (Fix 16)
The externalcalls displays incorrect native response code.

When the native service fails with 401 authentication error, the externalcalls
field in the transactional event displays incorrect response code.

This issue is resolved for both SOAP and REST API calls.

YAI-21448 (Fix 16)
The algorithmSuite setting delivered from a CentraSite deployment was not 
considered by API Gateway in its WS-Policy.

This is fixed, now the setting is maintained by API Gateway

YAI-21441 (Fix 16)
The API Portal application screen displays incorrect JWT token URL.

When you configure external authorization server in API Gateway and if you
request get access token from API Portal, the application created in the API
Portal dislays the local authorization server's JWT access token endpoint.

This issue is resolved. Now, in the API Portal the access token URL of the
external authorization server gets displayed. If the access token URL is not
present in the external authorization server the "Check with the API provider
for JWT access token URL" error message is displayed.

YAI-21404 (Fix 16)
When you use a WSDL with reference schema during SOAP To REST

apigw.auth.priority property gets reset to default value during every fix
upgrade.

The value of the “apigw.auth.priority” property in the
uiconfiguration.properties file gets reset to its default value during every API
Gateway fix upgrade.

This issue is resolved. Now, you can externalized the configuration by updating
the system-settings.yml to update the apigw.auth.priority property in the
uiconfiguration.properties is provided.

YAI-21006 (Fix 16)
Unable to synchronize the updated API scopes in the scope mapping across cluster.

When you update the scope mapping between an OAuth/OpenID scope and API Scope,
the updated scope does not reflect in the other API Gateway nodes across the
cluster environment.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-18054 (Fix 16)
Introduced the client ID in hyperlink format that displays the application name
and application owner information.

In the Administration>Security>JWT/OAuth/OpenID page, the OAuth tokens section
displays the Client ID column as hyperlink that displays the application name and
owner information.

YAI-22817 (Fix 16)
Displays error message when you import the archived API.

When you import an archived API, at times API Gateway displays the StackOverflow
Error.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22501 (Fix 16)
The server log displays a wrong error message during delete API.

In an API Gateway cluster, when an API is deleted, one of the servers correctly
performs the delete operation, while the server log of the other cluster servers
incorrectly displays the error message "Exception:Error while deleting the
record indexName - <index name>, type - oauth2scopes, doc ID - <doc is>
Message - Not Found".

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22452 (Fix 16)
Importing an existing application by a non-Administrator user fails.

message stating that the user is not allowed to perform the import.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22433 (Fix 16)
Server log displays incorrect log message

When an API invocation fails, which is API enforced with Identify & Authorize
policy and if you have set the identification type as Payload element, the
server log displays incorrect error message.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22210 (Fix 16)
Incorrect port names are generated in the WSDL belonging to a SOAP API.

While generating port names of endpoint entries in the WSDL names indicating
http or https are not considered. Hence, if there is a http-endpoint exposed,
its port name might contain the string 'https'. Although the number of port
names seems to be clear, their names are not leading to confusion.

This issue is resolved. The port name indicating http or https is now considered
for http or https endpoints so the port names are now displayed correctly.

YAI-22178 (Fix 16)
Port Access Mode Settings does not work as expected.

API Gateway UI does not display the actual access mode settings value in the
Ports page if the parameter portClusteringEnabled is set to false.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-22073 (Fix 16)
API Gateway does not evaluate Array expressions in JSON Path.

When queried with array expressions, API Gateway returns only the first element
at index[0] and the remaining elements are not returned in the response. To
resolve this, API Gateway evaluates and supports the Array expressions in JSON
Path now.

Example: Consider the following Payload.
{"firstName":"John","lastName":"doe","age":26,"address":\\{"streetAddress":
"naist street","city":"Nara","postalCode":"630-0192"},"phoneNumbers":
[{"type":"iPhone","number":"0123-4567-8888"},\{"type":"home",
"number":"0123-4567-8910"}]}

Following are the responses for the expressions before and after evaluating the
Array expressions in JSON Path.

Expression 1: $.phoneNumbers[1].type
Response before and after: "home"

Expression 2: $.phoneNumbers[0,1].type or $.phoneNumbers[:2].type
Response before: "iPhone"
Response after: ["iPhone","home"]

Expression 3: $.phoneNumbers[0,1] or $.phoneNumbers[:2]
Response before: no response
Response after: [{"type":"iPhone","number":"0123-4567-8888"} \{"type":"home",
"number":"0123-4567-8910"}]

Expression 4: $..firstName
Response before: "John"
Response after: ["John"]

Expression 5: $.firstName
Response before and after: "John"

Expression 6: $.address.city
Response before and after: "Nara"

This issue is resolved and API Gateway returns all elements when queried
with Array expressions in JSON Path now.

YAI-21882 (Fix 15)
Importing new version of Applications results in Access Denied on all related
APIs while the import is in progress.

If an archive containing a new version of an existing application is imported
while APIs using that application are used for requests, the APIs respond with
an HTTP status of 401 'Access denied' while the import is in progress.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-21569 (Fix 15)
While using externalized cluster configuration there are unexpected changes
observed in Elasticsearch configuration.

When using an external configuration file and you configure cluster
configuration, but do not configure Elasticsearch related entries, such as,
esClusterName, discoverySeedHosts and initialMasterNodes, some entries in the
elasticsearch.yml file are removed unexpectedly.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-21421 (Fix 15)
API Gateway does not store the archive zip file in the temp directory.

In API Gateway, when you invoke a rest call /rest/apigateway/apitransactions,
the archive of the events generated is stored in the 'temp' directory.
API Gateway deletes the stored archive file from the temp directory hereafter.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-21409 (Fix 15)

When you update a SOAP API, the update operation failed for PUT requests and 
you received an error.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-20551 (Fix 15)
JSON schema validation for a response fails.

When using 'Validation API specification' for response processing in an OpenAPI
API with JSON schema, the processing fails with an 'array too long' error. This
is erroneous as the JSON schema does not specify 'minItems' and 'maxItems' for
the array and hence any size of the array should be allowed.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-21645 (Fix 15)
When you want to move to the PATCH method, you can use the context-based routing
policy and select the PATCH option from the HTTP method drop-down list.

effective immediately.

When you remove the existing keystore alias and the key alias values from
'Configure keystore and truststore settings for outbound connections,' the
changes are not reflecting immediately.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-21078 (Fix 15)
If you configure a different port for a secured Elasticsearch in the cluster, 
and if you configure a sniffer to load balance requests to other ES nodes, 
the requests to other nodes fail with 401. This is because API Gateway
passes username and password only to ES that matches
the configured port. Since the port is different for other
ES nodes this credential is not passed to other nodes.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-20522 (Fix 15)
Reinitializing the API Gateway ports during startup causes problems.

During API Gateway startup, the exposed ports are activated, then removed, and
reactivated later. This leads to problems in customer environments.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-21492 (Fix 15)
Order of query parameter is not preserved

When an API is enforced with an Invoke Invoke webMethods IS policy and comply to

Payload pipleline variable is empty in the Invoke Webmethod IS service.

When you invoke a SOAP API that has REST transformation enabled and enforce the
API with Conditional Error Processing policy that has Invoke webMethods IS
service in post-processing, and if the invocation fails in API Gateway, then the
pipleline payload variable in the Invoke Webmethod IS service is empty.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-21104 (Fix 15)
An error occurs when you define an empty value for a header in HTTP Headers in
Validate API Specification policy.

For an API that uses just the HTTP header name, defining the Header value as
unset or empty in the Validate API Specification policy (or any other Request
Processing or Response policy that is enforced) displays an error.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-20561 (Fix 15)
If two SOAP APIs are associated with two global policies that have a different
set of policy action, and if you edit one of the associated SOAP API, and
activate or deactivate the corresponding global policy associated with the

A resource problem in the Integration Server health check returns an incorrect
health status.

This issue is resolved.
The resource problem in the Integration Server health check now no longer
returns a red state but returns a yellow state with a HTTP 200.
The overall status in the response payload is based on the API Gateway and
Elasticsearch cluster results. The Integration Server availability is implicitly
taken care since any problems in the Integration Server makes either the
/health/engine endpoints unavailable or impact the API Gateway cluster
health.

YAI-20816 (Fix 15)
Creating a SOAP API at times fails when the WSDL has external schema reference.

Issues in Query parameters validation in Validate API Specification policy.

When an API's resource which doesn't have any defined Query parameters is invoked
with certain Query parameters in the request, API Gateway returns 200 OK instead
of returning 400 Bad Request.

When an API's resource which has a defined Query parameter is invoked with that 
Query parameter with no value, API Gateway validates the null value against the 
schema instead of not validating it.

The issues are resolved.

YAI-19525
Wrong application IP stored for a SOAP API.

When a SOAP API is invoked through load balancer, the load balancer's IP address
is stored in the transactional logs as application IP instead of the original
client's IP. The X-Forwarded-For header added in the request to API Gateway with
the original client's IP address displays the correct IP address but the
application IP takes the value of the Load balancer IP and is displayed
incorrectly.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-16596
When you trigger the Restore operation, there is no way for you to find out the

API Details page is blank.

When you have created large number of APIs and if the combined payload size
of APIs exceed the value configured in pg_Cache_maxCacheSize
(whose default value is >100MB), API Gateway fails to load the API details page.
If an API is associated with the application, then API Gateway fails to load the
Application details page too.

Subscriptions are not created properly in a clustered environment.

In a clustered environment, if a subscription is requested from the API Portal
to clustered API Gateway, the subscription is created sometimes and at times it
is not created. If the request goes to the node that is the controlling node
then a subscription is created else subscription is not created.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-18470
Gateway scope import does not fill the authorization server scope.

When you import a gateway scope from lower environments (for example from test
to production environment) without defining the scope in the authorization
server, API Gateway does not detect that the scope definition is missing in the
authorization server and imports the
gateway scope as it is.

This issue is resolved. Now, API Gateway automatically creates the missing scope
in the authorization server, when you import the gateway scope.

YAI-18453
Invocation of REST enabled SOAP API fails with errors.

displays an error during the REST invocation of the SOAP operation.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-18391
In an API Gateway cluster the creation of APIs and Applications becomes slower
over time.

This happens when cluster members are shut down and new cluster members are
added. The performance degradation is caused by a cluster data structure which
keeps growing. This data structure is stored in the ClusterNotifierCache in
the Terracotta Server Array.

This issue is resolved.

The cluster data structure is monitored for absent cluster members.
If a cluster member has not reacted for a certain period of time it is
regarded as stale, and its data is removed from the ClusterNotifierCache.
The default value for this time interval is 900 seconds. The interval can be
configured in the Administration > General > Extended Settings section, the
parameter name being "clusterNotifierCacheStaleInterval".

YAI-18330
Deployment of packages and subscription fails when deployed through ABE.

Invoke IS Service does not support processing of repeat query parameters.

When you configure "Invoke webMethods IS" policy with the "comply to IS Spec"
checkbox being checked in request processing stage and if the incoming request
contains multiple values for same query parameter name, then only one value of
the query param is passed to the native service.

This issue is resolved. Now, when you define an API, set the query parameter
as repeat so that Invoke IS Service supports processing of repeat query
parameters. This is achieved by selecting the "Repeat" checkbox in the
"Add Resource Parameter" section of the API details screen. To access or
transform the repeat query parameter at IS Service, you must define the data
type as "String List".

YAI-18143

YAI-19412
When configuring XSLT transformations in API Gateway the API Provider can disable 
secure processing of XSLT documents by setting the 
http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secure-processing XML feature to false.

Because of this the API Gateway is prone to attacks where the API Provider can 
configure the XSLT to execute shell commands.

To overcome this with this fix the extended property pg_xslt_enableSecureProcessing
is used. This extended property is by default set to true and when true the API 
Provider cannot disable the secure processing of XSLT by setting the 
http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secure-processing feature to false. Even 
when set to false this will be ignored by API Gateway since the extended 
property takes precedence.

API Gateway sends forwards the session cookie sent by the native API in the
response.

During the request to an API on API Gateway, when the native API responds with
ssnid in the cookie, API Gateway forwards it to the client as is.
