YAI-24198 (Fix 2)
The Column with the type 'timestamp' is missing in the 'AGW_EVENT_AUDITLOGS'
table.

API Gateway creates the following table 'AGW_EVENT_AUDITLOGS' to store the audit
logs. Since the Column with type 'timestamp' is missed in the table, the
partitioning of the table is not possible.

This issue is resolved by creating a new column 'EVENT_CREATE_TS' of type
'TIMESTAMP' in the 'AGW_EVENT_AUDITLOGS' table.

YAI-16799 (Fix 1)

In API Gateway, table creation script for AGW_EVENT_AUDITLOGS table is missing 
in db2 and sql server database. 


This issue is resolved now.
