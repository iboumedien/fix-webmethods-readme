1.0 Fix Name

Installer Shared Libraries Scripts 10.5.0 FIX 1



2.0 Fix ID

WIS_10.5_SharedResources_Fix1



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix updates the common/bin/daemon.sh command line tool,
which affects all products that register daemons on Linux systems.



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

None.

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section of the Software AG Empower Product 
Support website at https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp



5.0 Platform Support

Installer Shared Libraries Scripts 10.5.0 FIX 1 is supported on
all Linux platforms.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

This fix updates the daemon.sh command line tool. If a daemon is registered for Platform Manager 
before the installation of this fix, then that daemon has to be unregistered and registered again after 
the fix is installed. The unregister and register must be done manually using command line for each daemon. 
The following example unregisters and registers the daemon of Platform Manager:

/Software AG_directory/common/bin/daemon.sh -f /Software AG_directory/profiles/SPM/bin/sagspm101

For more information see "Installing Software AG products", Appendix A.



7.0 Fix Contents

WIR-12316, 

Support for nologin shell (systemd, RHEL 7+, SLES12+)

In 10.5 GA version the daemon registration command line with common/bin/daemon.sh failed in some cases
if the installation user did not have an interactive login shell configured, for example if the installation
user had a login shell /usr/sbin/nologin. In such cases first install this fix and then repeat the same
command line with daemon.sh. After repating the command, activate the systemd service via command line
'systemctl start servicename' or via a system reboot, otherwise the daemon will not stop correctly
at next system shutdown.

Enhancement (AIX, Solaris)
In 10.5 GA version the common/bin/daemon.sh option '-E' did not have an effect on Solaris and AIX,
which means the login environment (/etc/profiles, ~/.bash_profile, .profile, etc.) did not get loaded
for the daemon by default. After installing this fix the daemon.sh '-E' option also works on AIX and Solaris.

The issue is resolved.

9.0 Uninstallation

10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods product suite and includes 
support for operation in any country, locale, or language as specified in the Installing webMethods 
Products guide. It was not tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this 
fix has no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported locale or 
configuration.



10.1 Localization

This fix does not require an updated language pack. It might contain new messages and these messages 
will appear in English.
