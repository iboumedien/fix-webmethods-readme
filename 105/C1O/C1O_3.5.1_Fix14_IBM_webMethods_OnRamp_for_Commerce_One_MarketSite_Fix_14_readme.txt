POC-211 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix7)
In webMethods CommerceOne On Ramp, the adapter's administrator UI pages does not
support the new Administrator screens of Integration Server(IS) 10.1.

This issue is resolved. webMethods CommerceOne On Ramp now supports the new 
Administrator screens of IS from version 10.1 and later. 

POC-203 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix7)
In OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite, the following error message is displayed 
in the error log when the adapter service is incorrectly mapped:
pub.flow:setResponse is using the value from parameter "response" because no 
value specified for "responseString" or "responseBytes".

This warning message occurs in the pub.flow:setResponse flow service when any 
adapter service maps the input parameter "response" instead of "responseString".

This issue is now resolved.

POC-197 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix6)
In webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite, 
wm.marketconnect.cbl:recordToDocumentString service generates the response 
message in an invalid format, if Integeration Server is restarted multiple 
times.

This issue is now resolved.

POC-196 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix5)
webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite support for new Admin screens 
IS 9.10 onwards. 

webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite Admin UI pages did not support new
format of screens developed for IS 9.10. 

This issue is resolved now by modifying the webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One 
MarketSite pages.

POC-182 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix4)
In webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite adapter, running the service, 
wm.marketconnect.tn.delivery:getProfileDirectAlias does not return the Alias 
of the intended trading partner.

The input to the
wm.marketconnect.tn.delivery:getProfileDirectAlias service is changed from 
C1OnRamp group to Delivery group. As a result, the service cannot retrieve the 
Alias of the trading partner.

This issue is resolved. Now, the C1OnRamp group provides the input to the 
wm.marketconnect.tn.delivery:getProfileDirectAliasservice. 

POC-179 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix4)
In webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite adapter, the errorRecorder 
document for the service wm.marketconnect.xdk.reply:createError contains a null 
value.

The errorRecorder document is missing the reference to the document, 
wm.marketconnect.xdk.reply:Error.

This issue is resolved. Now, the errorRecorder document contains the reference 
to wm.marketconnect.xdk.reply:Error document. 

POC-175 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix4)
In webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite adapter, changes to Alias 
paramters are not applied to the MarketSite Alias.

When you edit the Alias parameters of a MarketSite Alias in Integration Server 
Administrator and click Test Sync, the new values are not applied to the 
MarketSite Alias until Integration Server is restarted.

This issue is resolved. After you install the OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite
3.5.1 Fix 4, you must delete the "errors.xml" file located at,
<Integration Server_directory>\instances\default\packages\WmMarketConnect\config 
directory. Restart Integration Server. 

POC-152 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix3)
webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite Adapter returns an "Out of memory"
error if an error occurs when the adapter writes an exception in the C1 OnRamp 
Errors Log. 

C1 OnRamp Adapter returns an "Out of memory" error if an error occurs when the 
adapter writes an exception in the C1 OnRamp Errors Log (the error.xml file). 
The issue occurs because if an error occurs when C1OnRamp Adapter records an 
exception, the adapter tries to record this error in the error.xml file as well.
This behavior causes an infinite loop that results in an "Out of memory" error. 

This issue is resolved. Now if a read/write error occurs when the C1OnRamp 
Adapter writes an exception in the C1 OnRamp Errors Log, the error is logged 
into the C1OnRamp log file.

POC-159 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix2)
The "pub.marketconnect.transport:sendEnvelope" service of the webMethods OnRamp 
for Commerce One MarketSite Adapter always uses fixed HTTP content type. 

The "pub.marketconnect.transport:sendEnvelope" service always uses 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" as the HTTP content type when sending an 
envelope to the specified MarketSite alias. To configure the "sendEnvelope" 
service at runtime, the service should take content type as a separate input. 

The issue is resolved. The 'pub.marketconnect.transport:sendEnvelope' service 
has a new parameter: "contentType" String. Optional. The HTTP content type to 
use when sending an envelope to a specified MarketSite alias. If you do not 
specify a value  for the "contentType" parameter, C1 OnRamp Adapter uses the 
content type specified for the MarketSite alias. To specify the HTTP content 
type when defining a MarketSite alias: 
1. In Integration Server Administrator, go to 
Adapters > C1 OnRamp > Aliases > Add Alias. 
2. Specify a value in the "MarketSite Content-Type" field. The default value is 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded". 
3. Click "Submit Changes". 

For more information about defining a MarketSite alias, see 
"webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite Adapter Installation and User's 
Guide".

POC-158 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix2)
In webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite Adapter, a deleted MarketSite 
alias reappears on the Aliases page in Integration Server Administrator after 
you restart Integration Server. 

After you delete a MarketSite alias from the C1OnRamp Adapter's Aliases page in 
Integration Server Administrator, the alias is removed from the list of aliases 
on the page. However, when you restart Integration Server, the deleted alias 
appears again on the Aliases page. 

This issue is now resolved. When you delete a C1OnRamp Adapter MarketSite alias 
in Integration Server Administrator, the alias is permanently removed from the 
system.

POC-151 (C1O_3.5.1_Fix1)
When the WmMarketConnect package of Integration Server is enabled and an error 
occurs in webMethods OnRamp for Commerce One MarketSite Adapter, Integration 
Server generates a huge number of redundant log entries.

When the WmMarketConnect package is enabled, for each exception case in C1 
OnRamp Adapter, improper exception entries were added to the server log file. 
The number of entries added erronously is substantial and can cause the host 
server to run out of space.

This issue is resolved. Now a C1 OnRamp Adapter error does not create 
unnecessary entries in the server log file.
