WFF-862

WmFlatFile 10.5 Fix 8 is not cumulative of all the previous fixes.

This issue is now resolved.

WFF-777 (Fix 8)

File Polling Transport data "length" value is 0 in some cases
when the monitor directory is NAS directory even though the file 
has content in it.

This issue is now resolved.

WFF-789 (Fix 7)

"pub.flatFile:convertToString" omits Composite fields data
in the output for a Position based Flat File Schema.

This issue is now resolved.

WFF-755 (Fix 6)

When WmFlatFile config property "recordIdentifierPre105Version" is set to "true"
and Nth field Record Identifier is used,

a) "pub.flatFile:convertToString" adds the Record Identifier to the output.

b) "pub.flatFile:convertToString" does not add the Record Identifier to the
output when the field defined at the same position as Nth field Record 
Identifier does not include Record Identifier as value.

The above two issues are now resolved.

WFF-750 (Fix 6)

File Polling ignores de-duplicated files from the monitor directory.

This issue is now resolved.

WFF-728(Fix 5)

In webMethods FlatFile module, 'pub.flatFile:convertToValues' service cannot
process the records in batches.
This issue is now resolved and the service takes batchSize input to process the
records in batches.

WFF-703(Fix 5)

The webMethods FlatFile module was not reading the sef file with segment/element
description text and not displaying the same in the designer.
This issue is now resolved.

WFF-692(Fix 4)

In webMethods FlatFile module, 'pub.flatFile.generate:getFFSchemaAsXML' was not
able to recognize the UUIDs of CodeListValidator from the Flat file Schema due
to which the output 'FFXML' did not include UUIDs and was incorrect.

This issue is now resolved and the 'pub.flatFile.generate:getFFSchemaAsXML'
service returns the expected output.

WFF-690(Fix 4)

In webMethods FlatFile module, 'pub.flatFile:convertToString' generates an extra 
field delimiter in the end of the output string when 'noEmptyTrailingFields' is
set to 'false'.

This issue is now resolved and the 'pub.flatFile:convertToString' service
returns the expected output.

WFF-682(Fix 4)

In webMethods FlatFile module, 'pub.flatFile:convertToString' service used to
generate incorrect output when the extractor position of the fields in the 
flatfile schema are not sequential.
This issue is now resolved and the 'pub.flatFile:convertToString' service
returns the expected output.

WFF-677(Fix 4)

In webMethods EDI module, the wm.b2b.edi:convertToString service was not 
returning the expected output.
This issue is now resolved and the service returns the expected output.

WFF-676(Fix 4)

In webMethods FlatFile module, the pub.flatFile:convertToString service was 
returning an empty string for EDI data.
This issue is now resolved and the service returns the expected output.

WFF-664(Fix 4)

There's no input to handle line separators other than modifying FFSchema record 
delimiter based on the Operating System where the IS is running.
This issue is now resolved. In the webMethods Integration Server,a new input
'lineSeparator' is added under delimiters section to handle CRLF/LF/CR line
separators of 'pub.flatFile:convertToString' service output.

WFF-636(Fix 3)

In the webMethods Integration Server, when the newly added 
"recordIdentifierPre105Version" property is set to true the record identifier 
will not be added to pub.flatFile:convertToString service output for composite 
fields.

WFF-631(Fix 3)

In webMethods Integration Server, the pub.flatFile.generate:saveXMLAsFFSchema 
service generates the flatfile schema without an alternate name for the record.

This issue is now resolved.

WFF-617(Fix 2)

In webMethods Integration Server, pub.flatFile:convertToString service output
does not have the first line of the record identifier.

This issue is now resolved.

WFF-597(Fix 1)

In webMethods Integration Server, pub.flatFile:convertToString service fails to 
work as expected as Flat File module uses default operating system's encoding in 
place of UTF-8.
