7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.

This fix addresses the following issues:

WF-34119

Fix includes security updates with no new features to existing user-facing
functionalities.

EFF-444 (FIX_7.2_Fix8)

In IBM webMethods FIX Module, the copyright information is updated.

This issue is now resolved.

EFF-421 (FIX_7.2_Fix7)

In the IBM webMethods FIX Module, transactions go to a queued state after an 
idle time.

This issue is now resolved, where the middleware heartbeat interval sets to 60
seconds by default. If you need to modify, add the following property
'middleware.heartbeatinterval' to <Install_Dir>\IntegrationServer\instances\
<Instance_name>\packages\WmFIX\config\properties.cnf and set the appropriate
value. Restart the integration server after setting the property value.


EFF-403 (FIX_7.2_Fix6)

In IBM webMethods FIX Module, large number of Appia middleware logs were created 
in WmFIX/log directory. Currently, there is no option to change the log option 
or disable the logs.
This issue is now resolved and the appia middleware property
'com.javtech.appia.javatoolkit.middleware.LogMask' is added in the
WmFIX/config/properties.cnf file. By default, the value is set to 255 which
means all the middleware session logs are logged. To disable the logs
completely, set the value of the property to '0'. For various log options,
Please refer section 'Change the Logging Options' in Appia Middleware API guide.


EFF-404 (FIX_7.2_Fix6)

In IBM webMethods FIX Module, reload of the package creates multiple instances 
of some of the objects which occupy more memory.
This issue is now resolved.


EFF-393 (FIX_7.2_Fix5)

In IBM webMethods FIX Module, some of the objects created during FIX operations 
were occupying more memory.
This issue is now resolved.


EFF-388 (FIX_7.2_Fix4)

wm.fix.tn.trp:send service was not creating a TN transaction with the user
status as 'FIX_SEND_ERROR', when the specified sessionID was not configured in
the Appia Engine.
This issue is resolved and the TN transaction is created with user status set
to FIX_SEND_ERROR.


EFF-351 (FIX_7.2_Fix3)

IBM webMethods FIX Module 7.2 does not provide an option to ignore a list of 
message types and not store them in the Trading Networks database.

In My webMethods: Administration > Integration > B2B > FIX Administration page, 
all session messages can be ignored but partial list of message types cannot be 
ignored.

This issue is resolved. The following three built-in services have been added to 
select a list of message types to be ignored:
wm.fix.appia.session:addFIXMTsToIgnoreList
wm.fix.appia.session:getFIXMTsFromIgnoreList
wm.fix.appia.session:removeFIXMTsFromIgnoreList

For more information, see Appia Connections and Services section in 
IBM webMethods FIX Module Installation and User's Guide.


EFF-334 (FIX_7.2_Fix2)

IBM webMethods FIX Module 7.2 fails with the error 
"Error sending the FIX message. Detailed message 
[postOperatorCommand() timed out.]" when the send operation is 
executed in the same thread as the receive operation. 

Users can define a post action, through the use of a synchronous 
custom processing rule, for when messages are received by the 
IBM webMethods FIX Module 7.2. If that action includes sending 
responses back to the Appia server, the messages get 
stuck in webMethods Trading Networks with status as FIX_QUEUED. 
The messages are not delivered to the Appia server. 

This issue is resolved.


EFF-341 (FIX_7.2_Fix1)

IBM webMethods FIX Module 7.2 fails with the error 
"Error sending the FIX message. Detailed message 
[postOperatorCommand() timed out.]" when the send operation is 
executed in the same thread as the receive operation. 

Users can define a post action, through the use of a synchronous 
custom processing rule, for when messages are received by the 
IBM webMethods FIX Module 7.2. If that action includes sending 
responses back to the Appia server, the messages get 
stuck in webMethods Trading Networks with status as FIX_QUEUED. 
The messages are not delivered to the Appia server. 

This issue is resolved.
