WOK-13949 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix1)
The WmBusinessRules package on Integration Server does not remove created threads when a rule 
project is undeployed.
This issue has been resolved by removing open threads when a rule project is undeployed, a rule 
project is redeployed or the WmBusinessRules package is restarted.

WOK-14075 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix8)
Unable to use database auditing in MSR / Docker environment
When starting Microservices Runtime with database auditing turned on, the startup of 
WmBusinessRules package fails with an "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: 
com.softwareag.eda.webm.rules.auditing._2_0.BaseEventType" exception.

This issue is resolved now.

WOK-14116 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix3)
No error visible when rule project assembly fails
If an error occurs during the assembly of a rule project that contains Action definitions in either 
Asset Build Environment, Designer or the Business Rules UI in My webMethods Server, the error will 
not be visible to the user.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-14340 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix12)
Cannot deploy outdated rule project with functions to Rules engine
When deploying a rule project, which contains functions and has been created with an older version 
of Business Rules, to a Business Rules runtime on Integration Server, the deployment fails with an 
com.softwareag.rules.common.RulesValidationFailedException: 
java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
org/eclipse/jdt/core/JavaCore exception.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-14683 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix6)
The service "pub.businessrules.client:invoke" was only accessible with a WOKAA license.
This was changed so that "pub.businessrules.client:invoke" is now accessible with a WOK or WOKAA 
license.

WOK-14975 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix8)
Support MSR configuration templates with Business Rules runtime 10.5
A Business Rules runtime running on Microservices Runtime did not offer the capability to be 
configured through MSR configuration templates.
This issue is resolved.

WOK-14979 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix8)
CommonLoggingHandler does not allow to log without message key

This issue is now resolved.

WOK-14984 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix8)
Support a remote Process runtime with Business Rules runtime 10.5

Previously, if using Process Actions in Business Rules, the rule engine would call the process 
engine on the same host.

Now, the rule engine will call a process engine on the Integration Server Remote Server Alias 
"processruntime", if such an alias is configured. If this alias is not configured the rule engine 
will continue to call the process engine on the same host.

WOK-15328 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix11)
Cloud Deployment support
The Business Rules Development perspective in Designer now supports "Deploy to Cloud" to a Cloud 
Container solution.

Deployment of business rules fails with java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: 
com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore$Lambda$172
When deploying a business rules project to one or more Integration Servers, through Hot Deployment 
from My WebMethods Server, or through Deployer, sometimes the deployment fails on one or more 
Integration Servers. The Integration Server error log shows a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: 
com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore$Lambda$172.
This issue has been resolved by replacing the sometimes problematic lambda expression with a 
concrete anonymous class.

WOK-15663 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix15)
NullPointerException during rule project builds
When building a rule project with the Asset Build Environment, the build would fail with

This issue is now resolved.

WOK-15788 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix13)

deployer-common-acdl*.jar are present in the WmBusinessRules package.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-16333 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix17)

database results in a com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-16517 (WOK_10.5_RuleEngine_Fix20)
businessrulestargetruntime.isOnline=0 after initial start of WmBusinessRules package
When starting up the WmBusinessRules package for the first time on an Integration Server which 
connects to a MySQL database, the BUSINESSTARGETRUNTIMES.ISONLINE column wrongly contains the value 
0 instead of 1. This can cause Business Rules Hot Deployment to this Integration Server to fail.
This issue is now resolved.
