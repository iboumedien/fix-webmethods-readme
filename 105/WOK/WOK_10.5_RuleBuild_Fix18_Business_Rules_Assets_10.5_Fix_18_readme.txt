WOK-14116 (WOK_10.5_RuleBuild_Fix3)
No error visible when rule project assembly fails
If an error occurs during the assembly of a rule project that contains Action definitions in either 
Asset Build Environment, Designer or the Business Rules UI in My webMethods Server, the error will 
not be visible to the user.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-15328 (WOK_10.5_RuleBuild_Fix11)
Cloud Deployment support
The Business Rules Development perspective in Designer now supports "Deploy to Cloud" to a Cloud 
Container solution.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-15639 (WOK_10.5_RuleBuild_Fix12)
Duplicate libraries in Asset Build Environment\RULES
The Asset Build Environment\RULES installation wrongly contains the following files:
    ...\AssetBuildEnvironment\RULES\abe-10.5.0.xx-vxxx-sources.jar
    ...\AssetBuildEnvironment\RULES\lib\abe-10.5.0.xx-vxxx.jar
In order to avoid potential issues, these files have been removed.

WOK-15663 (WOK_10.5_RuleBuild_Fix15)
NullPointerException during rule project builds
When building a rule project with the Asset Build Environment, the build would fail with
java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.wm.lang.ns.NSRecordRef.getNSRecord(NSRecordRef.java:245)
This issue is now resolved.

WOK-16172 (WOK_10.5_RuleBuild_Fix16)
Missing dependency checks when deploying to Cloud Container
When using Designer to deploy rule projects to Cloud Container,
dependencies to External Event Rules, Process Actions and Predictive Analytics Actions were not 
checked and deployment of such rule projects was not prevented; dependencies to service actions 
were not checked and user was not informed of missing dependencies; dependencies to internal rules 
assets were declared.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-16252
Deploying rule projects deletes existing projects on Cloud Container
When using the Asset Build Environment to deploy Business Rules assets to Cloud Container 
solutions, previously deployed Business Rules assets are deleted and only the newly deployed 
Business Rules assets are available.
This issue is now resolved by adding a "RULES.skip.clean=false|true" parameter to the 
"<sag-installation>\common\AsseBuildEnviroment\master_build\build.properties" file.
