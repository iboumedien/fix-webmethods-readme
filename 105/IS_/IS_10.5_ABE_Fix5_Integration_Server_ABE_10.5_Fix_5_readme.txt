7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-73712
Repository-based deployment for file polling ports does not include the File
Name Filter value. 

This issue is now resolved. A substitution value named fileNameFilter can now be
set as part of deploying a file polling port. 


PIE-70263 (IS_10.5_ABE_Fix3)
Using Asset Build Environment (ABE) for building single packages ends with a 
failed build.

A previous change to deployment to allow system Access Control Lists to be 
deployed resulted in the inability of ABE to successfully build single packages 
for export.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-68986 (IS_10.5_ABE_Fix2)
Pre-defined access control lists (ACLs) cannot be deployed.

Now, Deployer and Asset Build Environment (ABE) can deploy a pre-defined ACL 
when that ACL contains a group that is not one of the pre-defined groups.

PIE-64508 (IS_10.5_ABE_Fix2)
Integration Server now supports deployment of email notification settings.

The Email Notification settings on the Settings > Resources page of 
Integration Server Administrator specify the email address to which notifications 
about critical issues on Integration Server are sent. Previously, 
this asset was not deployable.

The asset type ID is: isemailnotification

Email Notification settings have the following substitution values:

SMTP Server (smtpServer) - Server name or IP address of the SMTP 
server to use to send the messages
Port (smtpPort ) - Port that Integration Server connects to 
on the specified SMTP server.
Transport Layer Security (transportSecurity) - Whether any transport 
layer security is to be used when communicating with the SMTP port. 
Possible values are: none, explicit, implicit
Truststore Alias (trustStoreAlias) -Alias for the truststore that 
contains the list of certificates that Integration Server uses to 
validate the trust relationship.
Internal Email (internalEmail) - Email address to use for critical log entries.
Service Email (serviceMail)- Email address to use for service failures.
Default Email Charset (defaultCharset) - The default character set.
Username (userName) - The username for the account that Integration 
Server uses to connect to the SMTP server.
Password (password) - Password for the account.

PIE-69217 (IS_10.5_ABE_Fix2)
Asset Build Environment (ABE) builds fail.

ABE builds fail because of missing dependency declaration introduced with 
the multi-tenant feature for webMethods Cloud (PIE-68485).

Now, the missing dependency has been added and ABE builds finish correctly.

PIE-67009 (IS_10.5_ABE_Fix2)
Running the Asset Build Environment (ABE) on an Integration Server 
that does not have the features.cnf file results in a NoClassDefFoundError,

To resolve this issue, the jackson-core.jar has been added to the 
Integration Server classpath.

Now, the missing dependency has been added and ABE builds finish correctly.

PIE-63597 (IS_10.5_ABE_Fix1)
Integration Server throws an error indicating that the 'java.library.path' 
property value is missing in the Asset Build Environment (ABE) build.xml file.

This issue occurs only when Integration Server attempts to establish a 
JDBC connection to the database from ABE using Integrated Security.

To resolve this issue, a new property is added to the ABE build.xml file.

PIE-62727 (IS_10.5_ABE_Fix1)
Deployer renames ACLs during deployment.

Deployer removes the word "local" from an ACL name, for example the 
"local/Administrators" is changed to "Administrators". As a result, 
resources that use the ACLs are inaccessible.

This issue is resolved.
