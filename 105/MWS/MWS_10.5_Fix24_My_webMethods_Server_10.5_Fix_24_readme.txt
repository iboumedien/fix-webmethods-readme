6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. If MWS_10.5_Fix24 is the first My webMethods Server fix installed using Software AG 
   Update Manager then the fix cannot be uninstalled using Software AG Update Manager.
   To uninstall the fix later, stop My webMethods Server and back up the My webMethods Server 
   database and file system before installing the fix.
   Please see section 9.0 Un-Installation.
    

2. Before starting a Fix installation shut down all My    webMethods Server cluster nodes. 
   Software AG Update Manager will shut down and restart My webMethods Server during fix 
   installation. Software AG Update Manager waits for a preconfigured time of 300000 ms (5 mins) 
   for My webMethods Server to shut down and restart. If a particular My    webMethods Server 
   installation takes more time for shutdown and restart, you can configure the wait time by setting
   the following system property for Software AG Update Manager.
   -Dmws.shutdown.waittime = <time_in_ms>
   
3. If multiple nodes exist in one SAG installation directory, the Software AG Update Manager will 
   install the fix on only the default node. The default node is determined to be the node named 
   'default' or the first node subdirectory found in /MWS/server/. Other nodes will require that 
   the fix be applied manually. Following are these manual steps:

   a. Create a fix image containing the MWS official fix e.g. MWS_10.5_Fix1.

   b. Open the fix image using 7zip and locate MWS fix, e.g. wMFix.MwsProgramFiles_10.5.0.001-0033, 
   in 'binary' folder.

   c. Browse further inside the fix and copy content from \MWS\server\default\* to the 
   <SAG installation directory>\MWS\server\<server node>\*.

   d. Copy the fix xml file, e.g. MWS_10.5_Fix1.xml, from 
   <SAG installation directory>\MWS\server\default\deploy to
   <SAG installation directory>\MWS\server\<server instance>\deploy and restart the MWS server node.

   e. Run the command 'mws -s <server instance> update' at location
   <SAG installation directory>\MWS\bin and restart the MWS server node again.
   
4. If the cluster nodes are on different installation/machines, the fix installation should be done 
   sequentially for each My webMethods Server cluster node. Wait for Software AG Update Manager to 
   complete Fix installation on one My webMethods Server installation before installing the fix to 
   another cluster node installation/machine.

5. If you have a webMethods product that runs outside of the current webMethods installation 
   directory (the directory in which you installed this fix) and uses any of the files in
   <webMethods_directory>/common/lib, then apply this fix to the other product installation

6. If you are applying this fix as part of the My webMethods Server Overinstall Upgrade 
   from v7.1.x or v8.0.x or v8.2.x to v9.5.1, please follow the steps below:
   
   a. Complete installation of My webMethods Server 10.5 but do not select Upgrade My webMethods 
   Server Instances during installation. Once the overinstall is complete and the My webMethods 
   Server database components have been migrated, start the Software AG Upgrade Manager to install 
   the fix. This step will copy all the fix files and exit without trying to install the copied files.  

   b. Run the My webMethods Server initialization by executing the command "mws init" from 
   <installDir>/MWS/bin, which will install all of the upgraded components. After completing the
   installation of upgraded components, My webMethods Server will shut down automatically. 
   You can then restart My webMethods Server normally.
   
7. Applying a fix reverts the changes made to files MWS\server\default\bin\server.properties.[bat|sh],
   MWS\bin\setenv.[bat|sh], MWS\bin\mws.[bat|sh], MWS\server\default\config\wrapper.conf.template to
   their default values.
   If you have made changes to these files, please create a backup of these files before applying 
   the fix. After the fix is applied reapply the changes.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

MWS-30770 (MWS_10.5_Fix24)
The instance management commands for My webMethods Server do not provide an option for installing
the latest available fixes when creating or recreating a new server instance, or the OSGi profile
for a server instance.

The issue is resolved. The instance management scripts are enhanced to support the creation of
instances, patched to the latest fix level available in the configured fix repository. Now the
CLI utility for My webMethods Server will invoke Software AG Update Manager and install the latest
available fixes each time you issue one of the following commands:

mws new - to create a new server instance; mws create-osgi-profile - to create an OSGi profile for
a server instance. By default The CLI utility for My webMethods Serve looks for Software AG
Update Manager in the same installation directory as your My webMethods Server installation. You
can specify a different Update Manager location, and further customize the Update Manager
behavior by adding a sum.properties file in <Software AG_installation_directory>/MWS/bin. The
sum.properties file can contain the following parameters:

sum.install.dir=<dir> - Full path to the Update Manager installation directory. Optional. If empty
or not specified, the default is <Software AG_installation_directory>/SAGUpdateManager.
sum.image.location=<path> - Full path to an existing fix image. Optional. sum.empower.user=<user>
- The Update Manager user. Optional. sum.empower.pass=pass_or_pass_file> - The Update Manager
password. Optional. Valid values are: plain text, encypted password, or a password file. Specify
the password file as a fully qualified URI as in
sum.empower.pass=file:/C:/my_files/my_pass_file/sum_pass.txt. Encrypt the pasword using the
procedure, documented in Administering My webMethods Server. In addition, the CLI utility for My
webMethods Server will attempt to call Software AG Update Manager and refresh the metadata it
stores for a server instance each time you issue the delete or delete-osgi-profile commands.




MWS-32776 (MWS_10.5_Fix24)
<Remove me from the official fix readme>




WTN-6023 (MWS_10.5_Fix24)
Task Engine does not fire scheduled task events after you modify the original schedule time.

After a scheduled task event fires and you change the schedule time for the event, Task Engine
does not trigger the event again.

The issue is resolved.
