7.0   Fix Contents

- EXX-14648 XAI_10.5_Fix13:
   EntireX Adapter: Copy and Paste of Broker ID from and into 
   connections containing double back slashes will replace them at 
   runtime with double forward slashes.  This may cause errors like 
   "Wrong argument to Broker constructor: Invalid Broker ID"
   This issue is resolved now.



- EXX-14730 XAI_10.5_Fix13:
   Passwords are printed to the console in encrypted form.
   With this correction the (encrypted) password is no longer 
   displayed


- EXX-13802 XAI_10.5_Fix13:
   EntireX Application Monitoring Data Collector
   entirex.appmondc.filesperday=yes is specified.
   The new log file was started with a delay and data of the new day 
   was included in the log file of the previous day. No data from 
   the next day should be included in the file for the previous day.

   This issue is now resolved. 






7.1   Resolutions included from earlier Fixes

Fix 11:

- EXX-14251 XAI_10.5_Fix11:
   A call to a listener connection with at least one output 
   parameter of type Date leads into the error : EXX 0800 0310 
   "Unsupported field: YearOfEra".
   The issue is now resolved


- EXX-14346 XAI_10.5_Fix11:
   url-style BrokerID starting with uppercase protocol (like SSL://, 
   HTTP:// etc.) was not accepted by validation process. The 
   application hit the error "Invalid Broker ID".
   This is resolved now.
   With this correction the protocol part of url-style BrokerID can 
   be written now case-insensitive.


Fix 9:

- EXX-12482 XAI_10.5_Fix9:
   High CPU usage on Mainframe Broker when EntireX Adapter Listener 
   is started by two threads at the same time (standard package 
   reload by WmART and customer service) and reliable listeners are 
   used. This may end up in a loop were the Listener sends calls to 
   the Broker. 
   This issue is now resolved.


- EXX-13064 XAI_10.5_Fix9:
   The Broker ID used for SSL communication may contain a password. 
   The format may look like
   ssl://ipaddress:port?trust_store=trust.jks&key_store=key.jks&key_p
   passwd=thepassword
   How to encrypt the password associated with the key in the config 
   files?
   
   With this correction the Broker ID is checked. If it contains the 
   key_passwd, the password will be encrypted and added to Broker ID 
   with key_passwd_e. In this case key_passwd will be removed.



- EXX-13081 XAI_10.5_Fix9:
   Field messageID was included in pipeline of every service.
   With this fix only fields of the signature will be included to 
   the pipeline.

   Multithreading scenarios dealing with date values may transform 
   RPC data sporadically into wrong dates. 
   This issue is now resolved. 


- EXX-13467 XAI_10.5_Fix9:
   Editing the date and time patterns on the configuration web page 
   of the EntireX Adapter could add unwanted blanks to these 
   patterns which leads to DateTimeParseExceptions. 
   This issue is resolved now. 


- EXX-13539 XAI_10.5_Fix9:
   RPC Call may fail with

Fix 6:

- EXX-13007 XAI_10.5_Fix6:
   Appmon CSV files generated every one second: When the maximum 
   number of lines per CSV file - defined in the Application 
   Monitoring DataCollector configuration - is reached for the first 
   time then CSV files were generated nearly every second with a 
   small amount of lines. 
   This issue is now resolved, the generated CSV files contain now 
   the number of lines defined in the configuration.


- EXX-12644 XAI_10.5_Fix6:
   When using the "Adabas Replication Service for webMethods 
   Integration Server" the before image for update commands was not 
   provided. 
   
   With this fix the functionality is enhanced the functionality 
   that the before image of the data is also available.


Fix 4:

- EXX-12437 XAI_10.5_Fix4:
   Generating a REST Resource fails with "Failed to create/update 
   connection <connection>. Reason: FormatBufferException: no 
   programinfo found (Illegal metadata for program ...).
   
   This problem happens only if an alias name is specified for a 
   program in the IDL file.
   
   This issue is now resolved. 


- EXX-12447 XAI_10.5_Fix4:
   Running an Adapter service may fail with "program <name> not 
   found in metadata (available programs=)" when a program alias 
   name is used.
   
   This problem happens if an alias name is specified for a program 
   in the IDL file where the alias and program name differ only in

- EXX-12450 XAI_10.5_Fix4:
   A new property "User Transaction Id" has been added to the CICS 
   Socket Listener Connection,
   If a name (maximum length is 4 bytes) is specified the CICS 
   program is executed in a separate transaction with this name. The 
   transaction name can also be specified dynamically when calling 
   the Adapter Service. 
   
   This new functionality requires EXP105P004 for z/OS or above.
   For z/VSE a Fix for EXP above Fix 27 is required
