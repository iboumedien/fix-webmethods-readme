TAB-7751

Code in com.softwareag.platform.management.plugins.tc.lifecycle.BasicLifecycleImpl.exec records neither stderr/stdout
information nor the return code from a failing script execution. This makes it quite difficult to diagnose a failure
in the field.

Both the return code and the stderr/stdout content (both available from the ProcessExecutionResult instance returned
from the execution should be included in the thrown exception and/or logged appropriately.

This issue has been resolved.


TAB-7765

The MonitoringImpl implementation of the SPM plugin has unrestricted network interaction via URL/URLConnection.
It needs to utilize URLConnection.setConnectTimeout(connectTimeout) and URLConnection.setReadTimeout(readTimeout)

This issue has been resolved.


TAB-7797

A NullPointerException reported by the SPM plugin for BigMemory was linked to another problem that was encountered.
The logging around this should be improved so that it does not distract from the root problem in the future.

This issue has been resolved.


TAB-7837

Additional logging in SPM plugin.

It is possible to configure logging for the Terracotta SPM plugin by editing the log4j2.properties file, located in \profiles\SPM\configuration\logging

Add the lines below:

logger.99.name=com.softwareag.platform.management.plugins.tc
logger.99.level=TRACE
logger.99.appenderRef.tes-spm.ref=TES-SPM

appender.tes-spm.name=TES-SPM
appender.tes-spm.type=RollingFile
appender.tes-spm.fileName=${logsDir}/tes-spm.log
appender.tes-spm.filePattern=${logsDir}/tes-spm.log.%i
appender.tes-spm.layout.type=PatternLayout
appender.tes-spm.layout.pattern=${fullAppenderPatternLayout}
appender.tes-spm.policies.type=Policies
appender.tes-spm.policies.size.type=SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy
appender.tes-spm.policies.size.size=10MB
appender.tes-spm.strategy.type=DefaultRolloverStrategy
appender.tes-spm.strategy.max=10


TAB-7842

Terracotta logs tab shows empty on CC web. CC CLI has the same result. Weird thing is that server logs go under
`server-data` directory, which seems wrong. Possible that server logs location changed in the config, and thus the
plugin isn't able to find those logs.

This issue has been resolved.


TAB-7876

When a user updates the server name from cce/web all the keys present in custom_wrapper.conf file are lost. Only the
keys concerned with the server name are left.

This issue has been resolved.


TAB-7877

Introduce a common utility class which handles all IO operations to custom_wrapper.conf file

This issue has been resolved.
