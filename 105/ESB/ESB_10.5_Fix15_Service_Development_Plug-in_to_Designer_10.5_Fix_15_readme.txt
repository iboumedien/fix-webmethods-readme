7.0 Fix Contents

WED-9982
In Designer, lines of code disappear while editing a flow service.

In Designer, consider a flow service with multiple steps such as MAP,
INVOKE, and so on under steps such as SEQUENCE and REPEAT. While
editing the flow service using operations such as Move Left and
Move Right, Designer throws an exception that results in missing code.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9861 (ESB_10.5_Fix14)
Designer becomes unresponsive while locking or unlocking a map service
with complex mappings.

Consider a map service with complex mappings involving multiple
transformers, map links, map sets, and map drops. While locking or
unlocking such a map service using the context menu in the map
service editor, Designer becomes unresponsive indefinitely before
completing the action.

This issue is resolved. Now, locking or unlocking a map service from the
editor is quick and responsive. Designer refreshes the editor quickly
with the updated lock state. 


WED-9637 (ESB_10.5_Fix13)
In Designer 10.5, saving changes to a flow service on a remote Integration
Server is slower than Designer 9.8.

In Designer 10.5 connected to a remote Integration Server, saving changes to a
flow service is slower than Designer 9.8 when a pipeline mapping in the flow
service contains many Document References (number of elements to cache exceeds
999).

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9639 (ESB_10.5_Fix13)
Creating a provider REST API Descriptor from a Swagger document fails with 
"NullPointerException".

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9528 (ESB_10.5_Fix12)
A security issue with the Bootstrap library was discovered
in Designer Service Development.

The issue is resolved. The vulnerable version 3.3.7 of the library
is now upgraded to a more secure version (4.6.0).
 

WED-9529 (ESB_10.5_Fix12)
A security issue with the jQuery library was discovered
in Designer Service Development.

The issue is resolved. The vulnerable version 3.1.1 of the library
is now upgraded to a more secure version (3.6.0).


WED-9507 (ESB_10.5_Fix12)
Designer throws the following exception during cloud deployment.

<java.io.InterruptedIOException: Read timed out after xxx ms>

While deploying assets to a cloud environment, Designer synchronizes assets in
the local (source) repository according to the cloud (target) repository. If the
cloud repository contains more files or large packages, synchronization takes
more time, and the connection timeout happens.

To resolve this issue, a new parameter called "Repository timeout (seconds)" is
added under "Window > Preferences > Software AG > Service Development > Cloud
Deployment". This parameter specifies the connection timeout in seconds between
the cloud and the local repository. The default value is 240 seconds.


WED-9239 (ESB_10.5_Fix11)
Designer connected to a multi-user remote Integration Server does not
synchronize the lock and unlock states between the flow editor view and the
pipeline view.

When Designer connects to a remote Integration Server with multiple users, it
does not synchronize the lock and unlock states of a flow service between the
flow editor view and the pipeline view. This makes the users to lock and unlock
the flow service to continue with the development.

This issue is resolved now.


WED-9323 (ESB_10.5_Fix11)
Designer throws a NullPointerException while comparing identical services between
two Integration Servers.

Designer throws a NullPointerException when you compare a service on one
Integration Server with an identical service on another Integration Server by
right-clicking and selecting "Compare Element(s) With > Other Server > {server_name}",
where {server_name} signifies another connected Integration Server that has the
second service.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9315 (ESB_10.5_Fix11)
Designer incorrectly handles the breakpoints of flow steps in the flow editor.

In a flow service, the breakpoint enabled for a MAP or INVOKE step must remain
attached to the step regardless of the modifications to the flow service.
However, when the flow service is modified by adding, deleting, or rearranging
the steps, the breakpoint does not move with the original step in the flow editor,
which is incorrect. Similar behavior is observed in the Debug perspective as
well.

This issue is resolved now. 


WED-9195 (ESB_10.5_Fix10)
While comparing the current version of a flow service in Local Service
Development with a specific revision in the Version Control System, Designer
generates a NullPointerException and does not display the differences.

This issue is now fixed. 


WED-9060 (ESB_10.5_Fix9)
Designer does not publish REST API Descriptors (RAD) to API Gateway.

While publishing RADs to an API Gateway tenant, Designer incorrectly resolves
the host name of the RAD URL with the tenant machine's physical host name and
does not publish the asset to the cloud.

This issue is now resolved.


PIER-1466 (ESB_10.5_Fix9)
The Adapter Runtime and Designer do not support multiple metadata versions for
adapter templates. This issue is resolved in Adapter Runtime and corresponding
support is added to the Designer.

Now when you create a new service using Designer, it will be created with the
new version of metadata. The older services will continue to use the older
definition of metadata till they are upgraded to the newer version of metadata. 

WED-8852 (ESB_10.5_Fix8)
Designer does not support to drag the services from the Package Navigator view
and add it under the Pipeline view as transformers.

This issue is resolved. Now, Designer supports to drag and drop the services
from the Package Navigator view to the Pipeline view.


WED-8933 (ESB_10.5_Fix8)
Designer loads incomplete field values in the service input dialog for document
arrays with different field count.

During the service execution, Designer does not load the complete data structure
in the service input dialog as defined in the input file. Designer uses the last
document in the document arrays as the template. Consequently, Designer
populates the values of the rest of the documents based on the last document
which means if the input file contains multiple occurrences of field values,
Designer only considers the last occurrence and displays the respective field
values in the service input dialog.

This issue is now resolved. Now, Designer considers all the occurrences present
in the file and displays a unique set of field values in the service input
dialog.


WED-8878 (ESB_10.5_Fix7)
Designer shows the state of a custom or dynamic SQL adapter service as dirty in 
the service editor. 

In Designer, when a custom or dynamic SQL adapter service created on Linux is 
opened on Windows, the service state is modified or dirty in the service editor 
due to the difference between newline characters across Windows (\r\n), Linux 
(\n), and Mac (\n). 

This issue is resolved now. 


WED-8790 (ESB_10.5_Fix7)
In Designer, when the Pipeline and Properties tabs are placed side by side,
property values are not updated for the pipeline mappings of an element.
 
This issue is resolved. Now, Designer updates the properties of the pipeline
mappings when a mapping is selected in the Pipeline view. 


WED-8844 (ESB_10.5_Fix7)
Designer adds spaces and new lines while saving a Java service with old
signature.

In Designer, under 'Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter', if
the 'Indentation > Tab policy' is set as 'Spaces' or 'Mixed' in the active
profile, the Designer adds spaces and new lines while saving a Java service with
old service signature.

This issue is now resolved.


WED-8843 (ESB_10.5_Fix7)
Designer adds incorrect return statements while saving a Java service containing
the old signature.

In Designer, under 'Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter', if
the 'Indentation > Tab policy' is set to 'Mixed' in the active profile, then
Designer cannot save a Java service with old service signature. It also adds
erroneous statements in the primary Java service method, and fails to compile
while saving the service.

This issue is resolved now. 


WED-8825 (ESB_10.5_Fix7)
Designer does not generate a REST API Descriptor (RAD) from a Swagger document
present at an API portal location..

While creating a RAD using a Swagger document present at an API portal location,
if the API portal connection configurations are not stored in the Eclipse secure
storage while adding the connection under 'Window > Preferences > Software AG >
API Portal', Designer cannot generate the RAD. In some cases, even if the
credentials are stored while adding the API portal connection, Designer throws
NullPointerException while creating the RAD.

These issues are resolved now.

WF-15304 (ESB_10.5_Fix6)
Designer now supports fetching the solutions from Cloud Container and displays
them under a new perspective called ‘Cloud Service Development’. Designer also
supports debugging of Integration Server assets and services that are hosted in
the Cloud Container. 


WED-8751 (ESB_10.5_Fix5)
Designer generates the output template file only in HTML format for the selected
service.

Designer generates the output template file for the selected service based on
the “Name” field value under "Property > Output template" in the
“Properties” view. Designer does not provide any option to select the format of
the template file.

This issue is now resolved. A new property "Type" is added under "Property >
Output template". Supported values are "html" and "xml". By default, "html" is
selected. Designer generates the output template file based on the selected
format.
 
 
WED-8750 (ESB_10.5_Fix5)
In Designer, values of JDBC service fields that have SQL statements are not
fully visible nor can be selected when the service is in read-only mode.

In Designer, the JDBC service editor does not fully display the SQL statements
when the service is in read-only mode, nor does it allow you to select such
values. To view the complete SQL statement or select it, you need to right-click
on the service and select "Lock for Edit".

This issue is now resolved. Now, Designer displays the complete SQL statements
in the JDBC adapter service editor in read-only mode and you can
also select the statements if needed. 
   
                                              
WED-8702 (ESB_10.5_Fix4)
Designer does not store the output template name for services in Local Service
Development and does not allow to enter the template source immediately after
entering the template name for a service.

In Designer under "Software AG > Service Development > Local Service
Development", when you enter a template name for service under "Properties >
Output Template > Name" and save it, the Designer does not store the name once
the Integration Server is restarted. The Designer does not allow to add or
modify a template source under "Properties > Output Template > Template source"
immediately after entering an output template name for a service. After
entering the output template name, you need to save the changes and then you can
add the template source.

These issues are now resolved.


WED-8614 (ESB_10.5_Fix4)
After applying a fix or upgrading to a release that includes WED-7036 and 
WED-6846 the size of the flow.xml file for an existing flow service becomes 
extremely large when it is edited and then saved.
 
The size of the flow.xml file for a flow service that has a long signature or 
contains MAP steps with transformers increases dramatically when the flow is 
edited and then saved.

This issue is now resolved.

                                       
Note: WED-8614 is the Service Development companion to the Integration Server 
issue PIE-60577.


WED-8515 (ESB_10.5_Fix3)
The Resource monitoring service property is missing from the Transient error 
handling property group for MQTT triggers.

In Designer, a resource monitoring service cannot be specified for an MQTT 
trigger because the Resource monitoring service property is not visible.

The issue is resolved. 


WED-8292 (ESB_10.5_Fix3)
Designer does not support multiple connections to a server using different
hostnames, same IP address, and the same port.
 
In Designer, while trying to establish multiple connections to a server using
different hostnames, same IP address, and same port, Designer throws an error
and connection fails. To resolve this, a new checkbox, 'Verify hostname for
server connections' is added under 'Preference > Package Navigator' in the
Service Development perspective in Designer. By default, this checkbox is
selected and does not allow users to configure multiple connections to the
server using multiple hostnames, the same IP address, and the same port. If
users want to set up such multiple connections, users must deselect this
checkbox.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-8582 (ESB_10.5_Fix2)
In Software AG Designer, while creating new adapter service, the Adapter Service
wizard displays the deprecated templates.

This issue is now resolved, as the deprecated templates do not appear in the
wizard.

             
WED-8560 (ESB_10.5_Fix1)
Integration Server incorrectly deploys the assets to the cloud.

In Designer during cloud deployment, the variable substitution in Integration
Server Runtime Variable Substitution page does not work as expected.

This issue is now resolved.


WED-8561
Integration Server cannot compare two different versions of flow services from
Version Control System (VCS).

In Designer, while comparing two different versions of flow services present in
VCS, the comparison fails.

This issue is now resolved.
