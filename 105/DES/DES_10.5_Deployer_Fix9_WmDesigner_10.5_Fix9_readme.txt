WMDPD-9864(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix8)
Deploying several process models with webMethods Deployer might fail.

When deploying several process models with webMethods Deployer, a database connection
with a pending transaction might be prematurely released back to the pool. When this occurs
a new connection starts, which creates a lock contention on the original transaction.

The issue is resolved.

WMDPD-9865(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix8)
With webMethods Monitor, process diagrams cannot be manually saved.

The process diagram cannot be manually saved as a JPG and/or SVG file
and upload the images with the process metadata.

The issue is resolved. Support for manually exported images is now
included for the build and upload tool delivered with Designer, the
Asset Build Environment and Deployer.

DES_10.5_Deployer_Fix8, ABE_10.5_BPM_Fix3 and DES_10.5_Process_Fix6
should be installed together to resolve this issue.

WMDPD-10061(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix8)
Process Audit connection may not be returned to the pool after deployment

After deploying process models from a repository based project with webMethods Deployer 
the active database connection may not be returned to the JDBC pool. 
This causes the pooled connection to remain active and the physical connection to remain open.

The issue is resolved.

WMDPD-10151(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix8)
In Process Deployer build of BPM deployment set will fail when the set contains task assets.

This issue is resolved.

WMDPD-10095(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix7)
When writing data to PostgreSQL DB, Deployer fails with the following error:
Error writing data to the database: com.wm.app.b2b.server.ServiceException: java.sql.SQLDataException:
[SoftwareAG][PostgreSQL JDBC Driver]The hexadecimal string is invalid

The issue is resolved.


WMDPD-10079(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix6)
Software AG Designer Process Development uses an outdated version of the
third party component Xbean, which has known security vulnerabilities.

The issue is resolved. The Xbean jar is migrated to the stable version 3.1.0.


WMDPD-9959(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix5)
webMethods Deployer BPM plug-in fails to handle database error during deployment.

During deployment, if a database error is encountered while inserting metadata into
the process definition table, the error is written to the wrapper.log but processing
continues. The deployment is reported as successful, but the metadata table data becomes
out of sync. This causes subsequent deployments to fail with a duplicate key violation.

The issue is resolved.


WMDPD-9905(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix5)
BPM Process Model deployment might fail with the following error message:
"Error writing data to the database: null".

The issue is resolved


WMDPD-9949(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix4)
With webMethods Deployer, the deployment of an asset-based process 
model might fail.

The issue is resolved.


WMDPD-9889 (DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix3)
With webMethods Designer Process Development, after the deployment of a 
BPM project, the step settings changed in My webMethods Server are lost.
When the QoS step settings are changed on the source server from the 
My webMethods Server user interface, the changes are not visible on 
the target server after rebuilding and redeploying the process model.
This occurs when only the process model is deployed. When the deployment 
set contains the associated Integration Server packages, the QoS settings 
are applied and visible on the target environment immediately.

The issue is resolved.


RGHWPE-4389(DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix2)
PostgreSQL database support is added for Process engine.


WMDPD-9856 (DES_Deployer_10.5_Fix1)
