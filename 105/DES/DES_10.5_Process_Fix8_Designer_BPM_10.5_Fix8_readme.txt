With webMethods Monitor, process diagrams cannot be manually saved.

The process diagram cannot be manually saved as a JPG and/or SVG file
and upload the images with the process metadata.

The issue is resolved. Support for manually exported images is now
included for the build and upload tool delivered with Designer, the
Asset Build Environment and Deployer.


WMDPD-10067(DES_10.5_Process_Fix5)

The value of new option "Abort build/upload when trigger threads are actively processing documents" is not retained when Designer is restarted.

The issue is now resolved.

WMDPD-10096(DES_10.5_Process_Fix5)

webMethods Designer may fail to connect to MySQL when running on a Linux environment.

The issue is resolved. 


WMDPD-10069(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

The issue is now resolved.


WMDPD-9997(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

A new option "Abort build/upload when trigger threads are actively processing documents", is now added
in Designer Build and Upload preferences, to abort build/upload when trigger threads are actively processing documents.

Valid values are:
always - displays alert dialog and aborts build/upload if the trigger's activeThreadCount is greater than zero and trigger
  will be suspended and needs to be enabled in Integration Server.
never(default)- build/upload is not aborted when trigger threads are actively processing documents.

The issue is resolved. 


WMDPD-9656(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

Display error in "New Process Action wizard", in case there is failure to get ProcessData doc (and services) from the connected IS.

search results not properly displaying data model references from the workspace.

The issue is resolved.


WMDPD-9820(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

The webMethods BPM and CAF CentraSite Metadata Designer Help is deprecated for versions 10.3 and higher.

This help will no longer be included in the Designer Help content.


WMDPD-9726(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

Runtime settings in the process model like Quality Of Service (QOS) section is being stored in both the .process file and .config file which may get out of sync and cause confusion to the users.
This issue should now be resolved. The process model should be re-saved in Designer after applying fix and going forward the settings would only be placed in the .config file.


WMDPD-9264(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

If multiple processes are placed in same deployment project, the simulation report may only simulate deployment of 1 process.

This issue should now be resolved.


WMDPD-8814(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

This issue should now be resolved. A new property called "Generate Event Types" is provided on the process Runtime settings tab that can be disabled as needed.


WMDPD-9102(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

If Rules step is used and process model version is incremented, it may not be possible to re-build and upload process model. IS Error "node already exists" may be observed.

This could be caused due to Rule step re-generation.

This issue should now be resolved.


WMDPD-9702(DES_10.5_Process_Fix4)

Importing a process from 9.x to 10.x may cause some input/output documents to appear missing.
This could be caused if the process file had been created in an earlier version 9.x Designer which did not use the default namespace.
This issue should now be resolved. A re-import of the process to the 10.x Designer would need to be performed after applying the fix.

When using a boundary error, you may observe the warning 'Input for task/event has not been created as an output of any upstream task/event. This data may not be available to the task/event at runtime.'

This warning is not necessary for boundary events, as entire pipeline is available for boundary error handler.

This issue is now resolved. The warning is now suppressed for such transitions.


WMDPD-9533(DES_10.5_Process_Fix3)

If a custom Generated Service Name is used for a User Task, duplicate mappings may get created for both the service name and User task label.

This issue should now be resolved. The previously generated InputMapService may need to be deleted prior to re-building the process model.

PostgreSQL database support is added for Process engine.


WMDPD-9889 (DES_10.5_Process_Fix1)
With webMethods Designer Process Development, after the deployment of a BPM project, the step settings changed
in My webMethods Server are lost.

When the QoS step settings are changed on the source server from the My webMethods Server user interface, the
changes are not visible on the target server after rebuilding and redeploying the process model.
This occurs when only the process model is deployed. When the deployment set contains the associated
Integration Server packages, the QoS settings are applied and visible on the target environment immediately.

The issue is resolved.


WMDPD-9886 (DES_10.5_Process_Fix1)
With Designer Process Development, enabling a process for analysis might
fail with an error.

When a new version of a process model is deployed, an error occurs when
