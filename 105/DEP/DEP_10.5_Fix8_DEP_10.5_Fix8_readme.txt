5.0 Fix Contents

WDY-6246

In Deployer, when a runtime-based project gets exported to Project Automator, 
the "type" attribute is set for the "alias" element, which is nested in the "TargetGroup" element in the exported XML file. 
This behavior is not correct and causes a failure when running the exported file in Project Automator.
The issue is now resolved

WDY-6142

Running Project Automator fails with an error when the Project Automator XML file contains assets that have dashes in the name.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-6177

After you update Deployer with fix DEP_10.3_Fix12, Project Automator fails with an exception when creating a deletion set.

WDY-6020

During the partial deployment of a package, the Project Automator script takes over 2 hours to complete the script execution, which results in memory issues.
The issue is resolved. 

WDY-6349


WDY-6038 (DEP_10.5_Fix7)

Deploying a project that contains an email port fails with an exception.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6096 (DEP_10.5_Fix7)

Project Automator fails with a SAXParseException, when the exported 
Project Automator XML file contains target groups.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-6059 (DEP_10.5_Fix7)

When the trigger thread is locked by a process instance during the 
execution of a runtime deployment, the deployment report is generated 
without content and a timestamp.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6083 (DEP_10.5_Fix7)

When a flow service that requires an ACL is added to a deployment 
project (with "Add" selected as the option to resolve the dependencies 
for the ACL) the deployment simulation fails with an error. The issue 
occurs when audit logging is enabled.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5965 (DEP_10.5_Fix6) 

After a message trigger gets deleted, Deployer does not delete the 
durable associated with the trigger from a Universal Messaging (UM) 
deployment set when deploying packages to a target Integration Server. 
You can only delete the UM durables manually.

The issue is resolved. Now you can configure a new package property, 
named "Delete Universal Messaging Durable" to control whether 
Deployer deletes durables from UM deployment sets automatically.
To configure the new package property, go to Deployment Sets > Packages 
and click the name of the package. In the "<package_Name> properties" 
area, set "Package Type" to "Full" and "Action After Deployment" to 
"Activate". The "Delete Universal Messaging Durable" radio button will 
then show in the "Package Deployment Options" area. The default value 
is "No" and indicates that Deployer does not delete the UM durables. 
To configure Deployer to delete UM durables, set the value to "Yes".
Note that if "Package Type" and "Action After Deployment" are set to 
any other value, the new property does not show in the "Package 
Deployment Options" area.

WDY-6046 (DEP_10.5_Fix6) 

The Deployer.{sh|bat} script fails to run in a webMethods Microservices 
Runtime environment.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6035 (DEP_10.5_Fix6) 

When simulating a deployment or deploying a project with multiple 
servers defined in the IS target group, Deployer does not generate a 
report in the deployment history.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5971 (DEP_10.5_Fix6) 

When deploying a project with more than two deployment sets, only a 
subset of the packages get deployed to the target server.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-5903 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

After deployment, Deployer overwrites the start time and overdue 
settings of the Integration Server (IS) scheduled tasks.
The issue is resolved. Now Deployer takes the start time and overdue
settings from the source IS server and the task is executed based on 
these settings.

WDY-5912 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

In runtime-based deployment, the deployment of a project fails with a 
NullPointerException. The issue occurs because the node.ndf file is 
missing in the selected packages for the project, but this is not clear 
from the exception.
The issue is resolved. Now the NullPointerException is replaced with an 
error message that clearly indicates that the node.ndf file is missing.

WDY-5964 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

When creating the Deployer builds with Project Automator, Deployer 
creates too many sessions.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5971 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

When deploying a project with more than two deployment sets, only a 
subset of the packages get deployed to the target server.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-5967 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

In a repository-based deployment project, Deployer attempts to set up 
a file polling port before the related package is installed, which is not 
the correct order of deploying.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-5968 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

After updating Deployer with the required fixes, the WmDeployer folder has 
two tncore.jar files, one of which is an old jar file.
The issue is resolved. Now when a Deployer fix is applied, the old jar files 
get deleted.

WDY-5938 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

When deploying to target Integration Servers, the Integration Server port 
might stop responding, because several of the deployed packages get reloaded.
The issue is resolved. When the "Reload Packages" setting for runtime-based 
deployment is set to "Yes", Deployer sends an additional parameter in the 
pipeline ("reloadPackage=true") and the "packagesReload" service is not called.

WDY-5954 (DEP_10.5_Fix5) 

The Deployer user interface now has a new icon, from which you can access the 
new Integration Server asset type for the Email SMPT Server resource.

WDY-5917 (DEP_10.5_Fix4)

The package dependencies defined for a repository-based deployment 
set are ignored when deployng the packages. After installing the 
DEP_10.5_Fix2 fix, Deployer does not follow the dependencies of the 
packages in the deployment set and deploys them out of order.

This issue is resolved.

WDY-5920 (DEP_10.5_Fix4)

Deployer fails to connect to the Broker server version 10.5, even 
though a connection to the Broker server is configured in Deployer.

This issue is now resolved.

WDY-5902 (DEP_10.5_Fix4)

When specifying secure ports (HTTPS) in the Project Automator XML file,
the script fails with an error.

The issue is resolved. You can now create a project with secure ports 
for servers with the new '-useSSL' command line parameter. To configure 
secure ports, use the following syntax for the Project Automator 
command: {projectAutomator.bat|projectAutomatorUnix.sh|
projectAutomatorMac.sh} full_path_to_XML_file -useSSL

WDY-5916 (DEP_10.5_Fix4)

Deployer fails to connect to the AgileApps 10.13 version target server.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5904 (DEP_10.5_Fix3)

When the XML file of Project Automator contains an API Gateway 
configuration with a password handle, the Project Automator creates 
the API Gateway server with an invalid password.

The issue is now resolved.

WDY-5860 (DEP_10.5_Fix3)

Deployer fails to export the variable substitution for a project that 
has the same IS package in the deployment and deletion sets and 
returns the following error message: 'Unable to export variable 
substitution information.'

This issue is resolved.

WDY-5858 (DEP_10.5_Fix3)

Deployer displays the following error message for some assets
in a repository-based deployment scenario: "Comparison method
violates its general contract!". Deployer returns the error message 
when creating the Checkpoint for some assets in a repository-based
deployment scenario, or when transactional deployment is enabled.

This issue is resolved.

WDY-5869 (DEP_10.5_Fix2)

When simulating a deployment or deploying composites with the same
name, the message "Artifacts delivered successfully" is skipped for
some of the assets in the simulation/deployment report.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5854 (DEP_10.5_Fix2)

After updating Deployer with the required fixes, the server log gets
flooded with the "Versions of the WmDeployer and WmDeployerResource
package are found to be different." error message. The issue occurs
because this message is logged with each call to Deployer.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-5775 (DEP_10.5_Fix1)

When exporting project properties in Deployer, the export operation
is vulnerable to XSS attacks. The issue is resolved. Now the 
properties export operation does not open a browser window. 

WDY-5817 (DEP_10.5_Fix1)

The progress report in the Deploy tab of the Deployer UI is empty.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5654 (DEP_10.5_Fix1)

In the Deployer user interface, the audit log on the Log > Audit 
screen is not displayed with proper formatting.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-5661 (DEP_10.5_Fix1)

When importing an empty build and creating a checkpoint with the 
Deployer CLI, the operations are successful and the exit state is 
(0). The behavior is incorrect, because Deployer does not indicate
in any way that the imported build is empty.
This issue is resolved. Now Deployer returns an error when 
importing an empty build.
