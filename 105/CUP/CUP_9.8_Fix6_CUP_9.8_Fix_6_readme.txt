4.0 Fix Contents

CUP-113 Vulnerable 3rd Party Component Log4j used

Severe vulnerabilities affecting multiple versions (2.0 to 2.17.0) of the Apache
Log4j 2 utility have been publicly disclosed. These vulnerabilities allow
unauthenticated remote code execution.

The issue is resolved.


CIT-276 (Fix 5)
Cross-Frame Scripting vulnerability in CentraSite

A vulnerability audit has raised a security issue with CentraSite Control in the
context of cross-site scripting attacks.

This vulnerability is resolved.


CUP-76 (Fix 3)
XML External Entity Injection (XXE) through impact analysis.

An endpoint accepts a POST request, evaluates the XML that is passed through the
request, and displays the impact analysis diagram in  CentraSite Control. During
the evaluation of XML, it is possible to load external entities,  and  therefore
the endpoint is vulnerable to XXE attacks.

This issue is resolved.
