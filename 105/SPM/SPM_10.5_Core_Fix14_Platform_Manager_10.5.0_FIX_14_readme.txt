Software AG Command Central 10.5.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

None.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.


CCE-6437 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 10)
Platform Manager might fail to report a run-time component as installed 
in the rare case of using stale metadata.

The issue is now resolved.


SUM-4413 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 9)
When install fixes with Software AG Command Central always latest fixes
are installed even if older fix versions are selected.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-6187 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 8)
After executing database administration operations in Command Central, some of the messages logged
in the Platform Manager logs include the database password in clear text.

The issue is resolved. Now the database password is not included in clear text in the Platform
Manager logs. 


SPM-5180 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 8)
Installing fixes from a mirror repository fails when the Platform Manager machine hosting the
repository is set as a non-proxy host and the Platform Manager connecting to the Software AG
repository is configured to connect through a proxy server.

The issue is resolved. You can now successfully install fixes from a mirror repository located on
a non-proxy host. 


CCE-5952 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 6)
When you specify the fix ID of a fix in the "sagcc list repository fixes dependencies" 
command, the command does not return the fix dependencies.

The issue is resolved. 
You can now specify the fix ID of a fix in the command. In the example, the
command will list the dependencies for the fix with fix ID "SPM_10.5_Core_Fix4":
sagcc list repository fixes dependencies repo1 SPM_10.5_Core_Fix4 


CCE-6096 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 6)
Generating a fix image repository using the "sagcc exec repository fixes export" 
CLI command fails when a fix listed in the "artifacts" argument requires a 
specific operating system.

The issue is resolved. 
Now Command Central successfully generates a fix image repository even when
fixes require a specific operating system. 


SPM-5143 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 5)
In some cases when installing a fix using the "Install Fixes" wizard 
of the Command Central web user interface, Command Central displays an 
error and disables the selection of the fix. 
The behavior occurs when the fix you are installing has a dependency 
on a fix of a product that is not installed in the installation.

The issue is resolved. 
Now Command Central does not display an error and keeps the fix selection
enabled. 


CCE-5930 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 5)
Command Central stops applying a template if a product configuration 
included  in the template fails to apply, because the configuration 
does not support the Update operation.

The issue is resolved. 
Now if a product configuration fails to apply because it does not support
the Update operation, Command Central continues processing the template.


CCE-5727 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 3)
Command Central might not come online after starting up.
In some cases when Command Central is starting, it cannot discover the 
OSGI-CCE-ENGINE run-time component and Command Central does not come online. 
The issue occurs because of an JMX error.

The issue is now resolved. 


CCE-5721 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 3)
Command Central reports an ONLINE status for a run-time component 
before establishing a connectionto the JMX port that is open for the component.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central now reports a STARTING status of the run-time component when
the JMX port is open and updates the status to ONLINE after connecting to 
the open JMX port of thecomponent.


CCE-5660 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 2)
After you add a new product mirror repository, Command Central 
does not list its contents. The issue occurs when you add a 
product mirror repository, delete it, and then add a product mirror 
repository with the same name, but in different case. For example, 
the deleted repository is named "productMirror" and the new repository 
you add is "productmirror". Command Central does not list 
the contents of "productmirror".

The issue is now resolved. 
Command Central lists the contents of new product mirror repositories successfully.


SPM-5077 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 1)
The reason was that the "restartRequired" flag was checked on already installed 
assets as opposed to checking it on the assets about to be installed.

This is now fixed.

CCE-5513 (Software AG Platform Manager 10.5 Fix 1)
In some cases when deploying assets to Integration Cloud, 
the “Restart Required” KPI, is displayed when you are viewing instances in the 
Command Central web user interface. This KPI is only used for monitoring run-time 
components with pending changes that require restart.

This issue is resolved. The “Restart Required” KPI is no longer displayed 
in the Command Central web user interface.

location (9.7 or later products), or Software AG Update Manager to install
