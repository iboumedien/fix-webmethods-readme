Support for Publish and Unpublish of Connectors

the on-premises application to the desired webMethods.io Integration tenant.

Unpublish published connectors from a webMethods.io Integration tenant

CloudStreams provides you the ability to unpublish the published connectors

WST-5609 (WCD_10.5_Fix5)

Few back-ends expect percent-encoding of reserved characters in the URI.
When a URI-based parameter value, containing a reserved character, has a special
meaning (a "reserved purpose") and the URI scheme has a different meaning or purpose
of the reserved character, then the reserved character must be percent-encoded. An
error occurs if an URI with a reserved character is not handled properly.

WST-5583 (WCD_10.5_Fix5)

The look up details provided in the REST connector descriptor
for any resource are not added to the node-hints of the 
cloud connector service.

The resource metadata was not passed to the implementation where 
the node-hints created for cloud connector service. Updated 
implementation to provide metadata while creating node-hints.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-1864 (WCD_10.5_Fix3)
User cannot access or create updated workday operation dynamically as SOAP
operation generation by-design adheres to a specific version of WSDL.
 
CloudStreams now supports the creation of workday operations dynamically using
Designer. Users can create workday operations dynamically by pointing to a WSDL
hosting web URL or by uploading the workday WSDL file locally. As the user has an
option to feed workday WSDL file per operation, so the user can point to an
updated WSDL and any update to the WSDL are selected automatically.
 
This issue is resolved.

WCD-1846 (WCD_10.5_Fix2)
In 10.5 Designer version, for 10.5 Salesforce Connector while 
selecting operations, only 2 operations are listing rest other 
operations are missing

Missing operations in the "Select the Operation" screen of the 
"Operation and Business Object Configuration" wizard of the 
CloudStreams connector service with CloudStreams Provider for Salesforce 10.5.

While configuring a Cloudstreams connector service with 
CloudStreams Provider
for Salesforce 10.5, the operation listing screen lists 
only two operations for the "Operation and Business Object Configuration" wizard.

This issue is resolved.


8.0 Installation

Step 1: Install using the Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, 
see the documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: If you have migrated your connector services from a version prior to 
CloudStreams 9.7 and impacted by WST-2213, and you are yet to run the migration
utility as suggested in WST-2213, go to Step 2, else skip Step 2. If you have
created your connector services with a CloudStreams 9.7 or later version, you do
not need to run the migration utility.

Step 2: Run the CloudStreams migration utility (pub.cloudstreams.migration:migrate)
to migrate your old CloudStreams artifacts to the latest version.
For more information on the migration utility, see the Integration Server upgrade 
section in the "Upgrading Software AG Products" guide.
