In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can

SPM-5294 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 12)
In Command Central, when you apply a composite template on Platform Manager node 10.5, 
the job might fail when trying to import a snapshot template on the node.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-6455 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 10)
In Command Central 10.5, when you supply invalid credentials for the master repository, 
or have not accepted the product license agreement, the connection to the repository fails, 
but the error message does not describe the error properly.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central now displays the following error message:
CCEREPE0050: Cannot connect to the repository
Explanation: The repository does not accept the credentials.
Action: Check if you have supplied valid credentials and accepted the license agreement 
for the specified credentials. The troubleshooting steps are described 
in the Command Central documentation. 


SUM-4413 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 9)
When install fixes with Software AG Command Central always latest fixes
are installed even if older fix versions are selected.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-5952 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 6)
When you specify the fix ID of a fix in the "sagcc list repository fixes dependencies" 
command, the command does not return the fix dependencies.

The issue is resolved. 
You can now specify the fix ID of a fix in the command. In the example, the
command will list the dependencies for the fix with fix ID "SPM_10.5_Core_Fix4":
sagcc list repository fixes dependencies repo1 SPM_10.5_Core_Fix4 


CCE-5720 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 3)
When exposing monitoring data to Prometheus, 
Command Central and Platform Manager replace the periods (.) 
in the label values with underscores (_). The behavior is incorrect, 
because in Prometheus periods are valid characters in label values.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central and Platform Manager no longer replace periods with
underscores in label values. 


CCE-5350 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 2)
In the Command Central web user interface, the Installations page might 
load slowly if the hosts of some installations are shut down or unknown.

The issue is resolved. 
Command Central has been optimized to deal properly with hosts that are 
shut down or unknown, and the Installations page loads without delay. 


CCE-5635 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 2)
After applying a composite template with DSL version 10.2 or higher, 
Command Central starts a run-time component, which you listed in the 
"runtimes.skip.start:" property in the template definition. 
The issue occurs when the run-time component ID you specified in the 
template includes a variable, for example:
environments:
  default:
    runtimes.skip.start: My-Component-${instance.name}

The issue is resolved. 
If you now specify a run-time component ID with a variable in the
"runtimes.skip.start:" property of the template, Command Central does not 
start the run-time component after applying the template. 


CCE-5592 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 1)
In Command Central, when requesting the platform information of a node, 
the hardware ids may not be present.

The issue is now resolved and all platform information is available 


CCE-5499 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 1)
When applying a template in Command Central and the template contains an 
invalid port number, the Command Central logs return the following exception 
message when validating the template: ”Message not found for key SPMCTCE0000”

The issue is resolved. 
The Command Central logs now return the correct exception message, as follows:
"Unexpected YAML type String in field node port! The correct type is integer" 


CCE-5521 (Software AG Platform Manager Shared 10.5 Fix 1)
In the Command Central web user interface, when you use the Install Product wizard to install
products on an existing node, it might not be possible to select an "Install from" repository even
when several product repositories are registered in Command Central.

The issue is resolved.
