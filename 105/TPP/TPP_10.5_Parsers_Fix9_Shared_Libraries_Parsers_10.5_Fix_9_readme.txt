TPS-1971 (TPP_10.5_Parsers_Fix9)

webMethods Shared Libraries contains the third-party Jackson Databind with version 2.13.2.2, which has known security vulnerabilities:
[CVE-2022-42003], [CVE-2022-42004].

The issue is resolved. The following Jackson libraries have been updated:
> jackson-core is updated from v2.13.2 to v2.14.0-rc2
> jackson-annotations is updated from v2.13.2 to v2.14.0-rc2
> jackson-databind is updated from v2.13.2.2 to v2.14.0-rc2
> jackson-dataformat-yaml is updated from v2.13.2 to v2.14.0-rc2
> jackson-dataformat-cbor is updated from v2.13.2 to v2.14.0-rc2
> jackson-module-jaxb-annotations from v2.13.2 to v2.14.0-rc2

TPS-1735 (TPP_10.5_Parsers_Fix8)

The problem is that under common/lib/ext the older versions of Jackson*.jar are installed and not the once from TTP Parsers Fix 4.
This happens e.g. when installing API Gateway 10.5 Fix 25 on a system that did not have other fixes installed before (like new installation).

The released API Gateway 10.5 Fix 25 requires TPP.Parsers fix 4.
Earlier API Gateway fixes required TppParsers fix 1.
Due to this, the released API Gateway fix 25 manifest file has currently two TPP entries in the Require-Fix section, which are:

wMFix.tppParsers;version=10.5.0.0001 and
wMFix.TPP.Parsers;version=10.5.0.0004

After release of API Gateway Fix 25 some tests started failing, indicating issues with fasterxml.jackson.dataformat
Now we found that both TPP fixes are writing to the same location (common/lib/ext), replacing each other.
Unfortunately it seems that under certain circumstances TPP Fix4 gets installed first, then its files get replaced by the TPP fix 1 files.

The issue is fixed now by removing the wMFix.tppParsers;version=10.5.0.0001 fix as a dependency from API Gateway fix 26 and installing the
latest wMFix.TPP.Parsers;version=10.5.0.0008 fix, which will provide the latest Jackson versions.
