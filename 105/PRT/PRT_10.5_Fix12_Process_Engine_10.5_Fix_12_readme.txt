WPE-5136
With webMethods Process Engine, an error may be seen during startup.

After installation of PRT_10.5_Fix10, the following error is seen in error log when WmPRT package is loaded:
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.wm.app.b2b.broker.UMUtil.syncPRTDocs([Lcom/wm/lang/ns/NSRecord;)

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4993 (PRT_10.5_Fix10)
With webMethods Process Engine, when you execute the pub.prt.admin:suspendProcesses and pub.prt.admin:resumeProcesses services for process models with multiple versions, a "Cannot close latch" error message might appear in the server log.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4491 (PRT_10.5_Fix10)
With webMethods Process engine, logged field is incorrectly truncated.

Logged field values of type String were truncated to 512 bytes instead of 1024 bytes which the database allowed.

This issue is now resolved. Process engine now supports logging of upto 2000 bytes.
Note: ProcessAudit database component should be migrated to version 81.2

WPE-4909 (PRT_10.5_Fix9)
With webMethods Process Engine, a deadlock may occur under load.

A deadlock may occur with webMethods Process Engine when one of the
threads is executing handleRestartCommand while another thread is
executing the changeProcessStatus service.

This issue is resolved.

WPE-4819 (PRT_10.5_Fix9)
With webMethods Process Engine, process instances containing a Join Timeout transition
type might fail to transit to the next step once the timeout expires.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4864 (PRT_10.5_Fix9)
With webMethods Process Engine, an exception may be logged
during startup.

[BPM.0101.0002E] (tid=1726) Exception: com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nSecurityException

The issue is resolved. This fix requires IS_10.5_Core_Fix8

WPE-4858 (PRT_10.5_Fix8)
With webMethods Process Engine, custom ID may not be present
in the EDA events.

In long running processes, if Integration Server is restarted in between, the process EDA events
may contain no Custom ID though it was set correctly.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4811 (PRT_10.5_Fix7)
With webMethods Process Engine, the Process tracker may not process control operations correctly.

The Process tracker may not process control operations correctly when communicating with Optimize
and the process ID is missing.

The issue resolved. Process Engine now communicates with an updated Optimize MAPI interface.

WPE-4831 (PRT_10.5_Fix7)
The "operator does not exist: smallint = text" error occurs when running the Storage Cleaner procedure
with PostreSQL 13 due to not finding the storage procedure.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4792(PRT_10.5_Fix6)
With webMethods Process Engine, Process wide error handler step may execute twice.

A process instance that transitions to process wide error handler step is executed twice
after a join timeout occurs at an intermediate message event step.

The issue is resolved.


WPE-4788(PRT_10.5_Fix6)
With webMethods Process Engine, a process instance may fail to execute normally.

A process instance may stop abruptly if the Task Engine notification failed for any reason.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4716(PRT_10.5_Fix5)
With webMethods Process Engine, some process instances may not be upgraded.

When a new model version is enabled and the option is used to upgrade running
instances to that version, instances that were started prior to server restart
do not get upgraded to the enabled version.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4659(PRT_10.5_Fix5)
With webMethods Process Engine, triggers are reloaded after WmPRT package is loaded.

The WmPRT package startup service synchronizes internal documents to Universal Messaging.
As a result, the BPM triggers that have references to these documents are reloaded.

The issue is resolved. The startup service now synchronizes internal document to Universal Messaging
only when the corresponding Universal Messaging channel is not found.

WPE-4614(PRT_10.5_Fix4)
With webMethods Process Engine, Storage Cleaner logs its execution at INFO level.

The issue is resolved.
A new property, "watt.prt.suppressStorageCleanerlog", is added to allow you to suppress the storage cleaner logging
when set to "true". When the Storage cleaner is suppressed, logging is done at Debug level.

New Property Reference:
watt.prt.suppressStorageCleanerlog
Used to configure whether the Storage Cleaner logging is suppressed.
Valid values are:
- true - Storage Cleaner logging is suppressed. Logging is done at Debug level.
- false (default) - Storage Cleaner logging is not suppressed. Logging is done at INFO level.


WPE-4685(PRT_10.5_Fix4)
MYSQL 8 database support is added for Monitor.


WMDPD-9889(PRT_10.5_Fix3)
With webMethods Designer Process Development, after the deployment of a BPM project, the step settings changed
in My webMethods Server are lost.

When the QoS step settings are changed on the source server from the My webMethods Server user interface, the
changes are not visible on the target server after rebuilding and redeploying the process model.
This occurs when only the process model is deployed. When the deployment set contains the associated
Integration Server packages, the QoS settings are applied and visible on the target environment immediately.

The issue is resolved.


WPE-4618(PRT_10.5_Fix3)
With webMethods Process Engine, the status of a process instance
might be incorrect.

When a failed step inside an inline subprocess is resubmitted, the parent
instance status does not change.

The issue is resolved.


WPE-4587(PRT_10.5_Fix3)
Error may be thrown when suspending processes.

Suspending and resuming of process instances with
long name may cause database error.

The issue is resolved.


WPE-4590(PRT_10.5_Fix2)
With webMethods Process Engine, duplicate tasks might be created after suspending instances.

Completing a user task that belongs to a suspended process instance and
restarting Integration Server might cause a duplicate user task instance to be created.

The issue is resolved. A new property, watt.prt.enableRestartTrigger can be
added in prt.cnf config file. Set the property to false before restarting
Integration Server so that Process Engine does not enable the trigger during package loading.
If the property is not defined or set to true, Process Engine enables the restart trigger.

New Property Reference:
watt.prt.enableRestartTrigger
Used to configure whether the restart trigger is enabled.
Valid values are:
- True (default) - Process Engine enables the restart trigger during package loading.
- False - Process Engine does not enable the restart trigger during package loading.


WPE-4582(PRT_10.5_Fix2)
Process instance status might be different from the user task status.

With webMethods Process Engine, when a process instance is cancelled while My webMethods Server is down,
the process instance status and user task status are out of sync.

The issue is resolved. An exception is now thrown when the task status cannot be modified.


RGHWPE-4389(PRT_10.5_Fix2)
PostgreSQL database support is added for Process engine.


RGHWPE-4580(PRT_10.5_Fix2)
With webMethods Process Engine, an error might be found in the database
logs during package startup.

Process Engine issues a select query on PRTQUEUE when a package is loaded.
If the table was not present, which is expected in most environments, an error message
is logged in the database logs.

The issue is resolved.


WPE-4567(PRT_10.5_Fix1)
Task comments may be lost between process and subprocess.

After PRT_10.1_Fix4, there was a change of the process instances ID
associated in a task inside of a subprocess.

This issue is now resolved. 'RootInstanceID' parameter will be included in queueTask request pipeline.


WPE-4545 (PRT_10.5_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, pub.prt.admin:suspendProcesses
may thrown exception in some situations.

An exception may be thrown while a completed child instance tries to join its parent that was in suspended status.

This issue is now resolved.
