2.0 Fix ID

5.0 Platform Support

webMethods Application Platform Server Service Integration 10.5.0 Fix 1 is supported on the 
same platforms and operating systems and with the same JREs as webMethods 
Application Platform Server 10.5.0.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

None.



7.0 Fix Contents

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

PLS-398
webMethods Application Platform logs too many redundant error messages in the webMethods Integration
Server log.

A feature of Application Platform, which eliminates the necessity to include libraries already in the
Integration Server's classpath, causes multiple classNotFound exceptions for classes which are not
part of an application's packages. As a result, the Integration Server log file fills with misleading
error messages.

The issue is resolved.

PLS-445  
Access Control List (ACL) permissions change to "Anonymous" when loading a webMethods Integration
Server instance which has the webMethods Application Platform WmAppPlat package.

The Application Platform WmAppPlat package has a dependency to Integration Server. When the WmAppPlat
package loads in Integration Server, the execution ACL for all services under the pub namespace
change to allow "Anonymous" access. The ACL permissions are restored when the WmAppPlat package is
disabled.

The issue is resolved.

PLS-475
webMethods Application Platform logs too many JAAS initialization messages.

Application Platform uses a JAAS login module to bridge authentication to webMethods Integration
Server. Application Platform needs to periodically re-initialize the JAAS login module which
produces too many initialization log messages at the INFO log level.

The issue is resolved.
