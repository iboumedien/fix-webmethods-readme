7.0 Fix Contents

WEL-117
Designer does not support moving multiple packages together from user workspace
to the Integration Server packages directory.

In Designer under local service development, while moving the packages from user
workspace to the Integration Server packages directory using the right-click
context menu "Move Project to IS Package", Designer only supports moving a
single package at a time.

This issue is resolved. Now, Designer enables the "Move Project to IS Package"
option while selecting multiple packages. 


WEL-94 (WEL_10.5_Fix4)
Designer Local Service Development features do not work as expected when you
launch the Designer as a normal user.

In Designer, when you select the "Move project to Integration Server package as
linked resource" option under "Windows -> Preferences -> Software AG -> Service
Development -> Local Service Development", you must launch the Designer as
Administrator or you must have an elevated user control access to use the local
service development feature.

This issue is now resolved. 


WEL-88 (WEL_10.5_Fix2)
Local Service Development Preferences are not working as expected.

In Designer, changes made to the "Automatically reload IS assets after VCS
operations" option (Window > Preferences > Software AG > Service Development >
Local Service Development)depends on the status of "Move project to Integration
Server package as linked resource" checkbox.
For example, when both the options are selected or cleared, the changes
reflect fine upon save. However, if "Automatically reload IS assets after VCS
operations" option is cleared and "Move project to Integration Server package
as linked resource" remain selected, then the former option remain selected
after the save.

This issue is now resolved.
