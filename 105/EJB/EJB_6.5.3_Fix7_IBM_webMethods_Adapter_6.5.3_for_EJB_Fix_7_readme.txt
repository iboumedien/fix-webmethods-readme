POJ-217

POJ-185 (EJB_6.5.3_Fix6) 
webMethods Enterprise JavaBeans Adapter now supports WebLogic 14c.

POJ-170 (EJB_6.5.3_Fix5)

provided.

This issue is now resolved.

POJ-164 (EJB_6.5.3_Fix4) 
In webMethods Enterprise JavaBeans Adapter, 'MethodResults' from 
FetchInvokeEJB3.0 does not have a index which causes 'Results' becomes null.

POJ-159 (EJB_6.5.3_Fix3) 
In webMethods Enterprise JavaBeans Adapter, instances of TransactionHelperImpl 
grows when calling adapter service with CreateInvokeEJB 2.1 template.

This memory leak occurs as weblogic server creates a new context when we call 
getRemoteBean api on the EJB Handle as part of executing CreateInvokeEJB 2.1 
template.

This isssue is resolved by deactivating tansaction helper using the weblogic 
util API. 

POJ-155 (EJB_6.5.3_Fix2) 
In webMethods Enterprise JavaBeans Adapter, instances of TransactionHelperImpl 
grows when reload of values happens in the adapter template.

This memory leak occurs as the contexts of weblogic server are not closed when 
look up for EJBs happens.

This isssue is resolved by closing the weblogic server contexts after EJB lookups.
