fix set.


7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in 
services, APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the 
fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

NUM-18668 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

When you enable the ThreadDumpOnSlowTask thread-pool monitoring property, Universal Messaging might 
generate many thread dumps over a short time, which could slow performance.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18515 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

In a Universal Messaging (UM) cluster that uses multiplexed sessions, the primary realm server 
instance stops responding because of increased CPU usage, which stalls the tasks on the UM server. 
The issue occurs when the multiplexed SSL session between the server and client does not close 
properly.
The issue is resolved.
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: closing inbound before receiving peer's close_notify
The fix for this issue involves correcting and refactoring specific code in the server's NIO layer 
to address the issue.

NUM-18435 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

ReadPool tasks could be stalled when connections are abruptly closed. This defect manifests itself 
by server log entries such as 
[Mon Jul 11 10:37:55.294 CEST 2022] [UM-Monitor-Thread] ThreadPool: <ReadPool> Stalled task found, 
Thread ReadPool:86 has been active for 61500(ms) running task class 
com.pcbsys.foundation.drivers.fServerHTTPDriver$OpenConnection, Idle Threads 89, Allocated Threads 
100, Queued Tasks 0, Task Executed 1807968920
This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-18421 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

Universal Messaging might log thread dumps twice in nirvana.log.
When a stalled or slow moving task is detected, or a thread dump is requested, it might be logged 
twice in nirvana.log which is unnecessary.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17868 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

Previously if  protobuf descriptors were updated for the channel on master/slave node, all other 
nodes stayed with old protobuf descriptors. 
And if the master was restarted,  the new master was selected and all nodes again restore old 
protobuf descriptors.
Durable filters were not able to be applied to the event and stopped receiving events at this point.
Now it is fixed and each node of the cluster will update channel protobuf descriptors when it is 
changed in one of the nodes.

NUM-18263 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix19)

When Universal Messaging is configured to use the Logback framework, rolling the logs might fail 
with an exception.
When rolling the logs on a Windows operating system, if the Logback framework fails to rename a log 
file, it throws a NullPointerException.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now supports version 1.2.11 of the Logback framework.

NUM-18121 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix19)

Improve the performance of cluster pipeline processing by using a different data structure.

NUM-17960 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

The fix for this issue can improve cluster node recovery times and prevent a recovery loop from 
occurring. This applies directly to any channel or queue that employs multi file storage.

NUM-17870 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

Universal Messaging audit logging for cluster operations has been enhanced.
The server now creates audit logging events for each cluster operation depending
on whether the 'RealmSuccess' audit realm configuration property or 'RealmFailure'
audit realm configuration property is set to 'true'.
In addition, Universal Messaging logs connection details and information about
the user who performs the following actions:
- Creates a cluster
- Adds a member to a cluster
- Removes a member from a cluster
- Destroys a cluster
For more information about the 'RealmSuccess' and 'RealmFailure' properties and server
audit logging, see the Universal Messaging documentation.

NUM-17688 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

UM previously supported only filters like: 'document.field = stringField',
but did not support filters like 'stringField=document.field', i.e. where RHS expression of filter 
contains document nested fields.
Now it is fixed and nested fields can be used in right hand side of  filter expression (for now 
except boolean fields values).

NUM-16633 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

For a cluster wide zone based channel, it is possible that events will not get forwarded from a 
source cluster to a target cluster that is in the same zone.  Nodes that are in a target cluster 
could overwrite the interest of one another, and show a lack of consumer interest even though an 
actual consumer is present.
This issue is now resolved by properly noting the interest that is received from all nodes in the 
target cluster.

NUM-17909 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

A Universal Messaging realm server logs errors about insufficient disk space even when the free disk 
space is sufficient.
The server logs an error into the nirvana.log file that "Free disk space has reduced below warning 
threshold percentage."
The issue is resolved. Now the server logs an error message only when the free disk space required 
for the realm server to continue processing is below the defined minimum threshold.

NUM-17857 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

New system property called "nirvana.ExternalRA" has been added which allows UM to use an external 
Resource Adapter when set to true (e.g. "-Dnirvana.ExternalRA=true"). The UM need to be restarted 
after switching the Universal Messaging Resource Adapter with external one.
The issue is now resolved

NUM-17735 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

Universal Messaging now offers more verbose logging related to DNS resolution.

NUM-17689 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager shows a negative value for Current Connections in the Totals 
section for a shared or serial durable.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17556 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

During the implementation of Bidirectional Client Support we inadvertently changed logs around 
initial connection and authentication which removed clarity of connection failures.
We have reinstated all log entries related to connection and authentication failures.
There was further work done to remediated interface statistics calculations to be accurate for all 
types of connections (UM Native Protocol, MQTT, AMQP, Javascript and all HTTP connections) which 
allows the Total Connection, Authentication Time and Failed connection statistics to be accurate 
for each interface.
Under certain conditions an exception was logged java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException from a thread 
stack including the class ServerLoginContextNegotiator this defect has been resolved, it was a non 
fatal though the log entry did not indicate this. 
Two configuration items have been remove NHPScanTime and NHPTimeout from the 'Global Values' 
Configuration group, the behavior of these configuration items is now consolidated under the 
'Connection Config' group setting IdleDriverTimeout.

NUM-17275 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

Improved the logging for missing JAAS login module

NUM-15541 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

When client is performing nTransaction#commit inside a cluster on a slave node and at the same time 
the channel is deleted on the master node the master will not respond to the slave which will lead
to the connection between these two being interrupted after the MasterRequestTimeout has passed. 
This can lead to downtime in the UM cluster. 
This issue is now fixed.

NUM-17625 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

Universal Messaging now supports wildcards in the exempt file that enables users to bypass 
authentication when authentication is mandatory.
The exempt file supports wildcard entries using the * (asterisk) symbol including user@* and *@host. 
However, *@* is not supported because it will allow any user to bypass authentication.
Note: The username ?*? is a valid username, but if you add such a user to the exempt list, the user 
will be read as a wildcard. In such cases, Software AG recommends against using the ?*? username.
You must define exempt users explicitly by configuring the 
-DNirvana.auth.exempt=<path_to_exempt_file> property in the Server_Common.conf file. Universal 
Messaging no longer uses the -DSECURITYFILE to load exempt users.
In addition, users both with and without a password on the exempt list should be able to log in 
successfully.
For more information about working with the exempt list and the -DNirvana.auth.exempt property, see 
the Universal Messaging web help.

NUM-17608 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

UM server was not able to handle more then thousand simultaneous MQTT connection gracefully- MQTT 
connect time would increase and MQTT clients might start experiencing connect timeouts. 
This is now resolved by optimizing the MQTT connect handling on the server. Depending on the 
environment used, single UM server should be able to handle more then 5000 MQTT connect operations 
simultaneously.
Also UM's ability to work with thousands stores and consumers is also improved.
Following important optimizations were added as part of this fix:
- Durable state saving was optimized by using an buffered output stream, so the save operation is 
performed faster on disk.
- MQTT configuration to configure the EventsPerSpinle channel configuration for auto created topics 
is added:
"Protocol MQTT Config"-> "AutoCreatedStoreSpindleSize". Defaults to 50000. Previously stores were 
created with eventsPerSpindle = 0, which was leading to MQTT auto created stores were created as 
non-multifile stores.
- Durable config was added to enable\disable the Consumer State Monitor.
In case of many consumers, the consumer state monitor used for monitor consumer's health might add 
an additional overhead which can affect the performance of the UM server's Scheduler Pool.
"DurableConfig"->"EnableConsumerStateMonitor". Default value is true, to disable the consumer 
monitor set the value to false.
- A ConcurrentModificationException in the nInterestStorageValidator is fixed.
- For single UM server deployment (non-A/A clustering), the duplicate MQTT ClientID detection is 
optimized to not persist connection state on disk.

NUM-17552 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

You can create a non-clustered durable on a clustered channel in a Universal Messaging cluster.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now disregards the nDurableAttributes#isClustered flag. 
When you create a durable object on a clustered channel the durable is clustered even if
the isClustered attribute flag is set to 'false'.

NUM-17327 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

When using Protobuf messages, UM uses the default Protobuf 3 values. This behavior is now 
configurable via a server side configuration option - TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull . Its default value is 
false to retain the current behavior where unset string fields are treated as empty strings and not 
NULL. To change that behavior and treat unset fields as NULL,  set the configuration value of 
TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull to true. 
One can configure TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull via EnterpriseManager->Realm->Config->Show Advanced 
Config->Advanced Configuration->Protobuf Config->TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull.

NUM-17277 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

Restarting Universal Messaging fails with a file I/O error.
The issue might occur when the server tries to load a shared or serial durable with a
selector that has an event buffer size of more than 10 000 symbols. In this case,
Universal Messaging writes the following error in the nirvana.log file:
"Server shutdown initiated due to fatal file I/O error occurred: Unable to load the durable
from, corruption detected...Input exceeded input buffer size."
The issue is resolved. You can now create durables with selectors that have an input event buffer 
size of more than 10 000 symbols.

NUM-13153 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

Change default interface accept thread to 10 by adding the accept thread in the boot strap file.

NUM-17247 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

Creating a new session to Universal Messaging might fail when working with temporary stores that 
have the autoDelete flag enabled.
Session creation fails with the message "com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nUnexpectedResponseException:
Received an unexpected response to the request: Unexpected response to handshake request,
class com.pcbsys.nirvana.base.events.nDeleteChannel".
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17150 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

After migrating to Universal Messaging version 10.1 or above, a secondary node goes down because the 
connection used for a multiplex session stalls.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17120 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

When clients use the Universal Messaging channel iterator client API to consume events from
a channel with a shared durable, pausing a session to the server might cause messages to be 
perceived as lost.
The issue occurs because the server does not suspend subscriptions properly when a session is 
paused.
In this case, the server might send events to consumers while the consumers are not ready to process 
them.
Such events are perceived as lost, but will be redelivered once the session is closed and a new one 
is established.
This issue is resolved. Now the Universal Messaging server times out all durable subscriptions
when a session is paused, and clients receive a nRequestTimedOutException.

NUM-17062 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

During the cluster destruction process, there could be a communication task executing, that updates 
a server's known state of remote nodes. There was a possibility that those two processes could 
interfere with each other, resulting in a NullPointerException logged in the server log file. This 
issue is now resolved.

NUM-16830 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

The Universal Messaging realm server has memory and performance issues when a memory leak occurs in 
the task scheduler.
The issue is resolved. 

NUM-16785 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Having a username that contains "@" results in Universal Messaging logging the exception message 
"Unexpected subject/address format.?, which might flood the nirvana.log and client.log file.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-15870 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Improved server start-up when a large number of stores are loaded.

NUM-15364 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Java Template Applications are now available for AIX.

NUM-14326 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

After an exclusive durable gets deleted, the client might still receive events from the deleted 
durable.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-13618 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Changing the <RealmName> of an existing Universal Messaging (UM) server instance through the REALM 
server parameter in the Server_Common.conf file after starting the server instance might result in 
issues.
The issue is resolved. Now you cannot change the <RealmName> of a UM server instance after creating 
the server instance.

NUM-10065 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

When non-durable JMS sync consumer on channel was re-subscribed and there are no new events 
published- it was possible the UM server to not delete the old events kept by the old subscriber.
This is now fixed- when the new consumer is added it will properly reset its interest and the old 
events for which we don't have interest anymore will be deleted.

NUM-16661 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

After enabling trace logging from Enterprise Manager, the server log shows messages that do not give 
clear details about the traced issue and originate from UM private channels.
The issue is resolved. When trace logging is enabled, Universal Messaging now logs only messages 
from the consumer channels. The log messages now give more information, such as which event details 
are retrieved and from which store. 

NUM-16517 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Creating and then deleting many channels or queues might result in Universal Messaging leaking 
memory and shutting down. 
The issue is now resolved. 

NUM-16457 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Despite using a network drive as a data directory, Universal Messaging might store some .mem files 
locally. 
Universal Messaging might incorrectly save some .mem files on a local drive, even though you are 
using a network drive as a data directory for storing channels and queues. 
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-16367 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Recovering empty indexed durables in a cluster might result in failed inter-realm communication 
between the master node and a secondary node.
The issue can occur when no events are waiting to be delivered on the durable or the number of 
events on the master and the secondary node is equal.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16350 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Server status log now will display the open file descriptor on Unix platform

NUM-16257 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

A NullPointerException occurs randomly in a Universal Messaging server when you try to publish 
events to a channel.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16249 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Synchronous durable topic or queue consumers that have low timeout values (tenths of milliseconds or 
less) and consume messages from a slave realm in a Universal Messaging cluster might stop consuming 
messages and log the following message in the nirvana.log file for the slave realm:
"Cluster> Rolling back Event IDs to allocate for a local connection that no longer exists."
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now has the "TimeoutSynchronousConsumerOnMaster" advanced 
realm configuration property that you can use to switch the timeout procedure to the master realm 
in the cluster. Valid values for the new property are:
true - switches the timeout procedure to the master realm in the cluster
false (default) - the timeout procedure is run on a slave realm in the cluster
Important! You must configure the new property after updating all realms in the cluster to the fix 
version of the master realm.

NUM-16160 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Issue with high disk usage has been resolved.

NUM-16145 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

An issue with high CPU and memory usage is observed in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16068 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

When a durable is corrupted, Universal Messaging shuts down with an error message that does not 
include the name of the corrupted .idx or .txn file.
The server returns the following general error in the nirvana.log file: "Server shutdown initiated 
due to fatal file
I/O error occurred : Failed during openOrCreate null."
The issue is resolved. Server logging has been improved to include the name of the corrupted durable 
file.

NUM-16033 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Filter expressions in UM involving NULL were not evaluated correctly and used to return wrong 
results. This issue is now fixed. 

NUM-15970 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

When nProtobuf events get published from a Universal Messaging server to the client, the events are 
not processed in the correct order. The issue occurs because the custom Protobuf attributes are not 
set in the nProtobuf events.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15796 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

New system property called "nirvana.ExternalRA" has been added which allows UM to use an external 
Resource Adapter when set to true (e.g. "-Dnirvana.ExternalRA=true"). The UM need to be restarted 
after switching the Universal Messaging Resource Adapter with external one.
The issue is now resolved

NUM-15668 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Universal Messaging reports a ConcurrentModificationException due to synchronization issues with 
multi-file disk stores.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15345 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

MQTT multi-level wildcard subscriptions do not match topics in the root context.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-16198 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

The Universal Messaging server or Java client might fail to start after you apply
Universal Messaging 10.5 realm server fix 11 or Universal Messaging 10.5 Java client fix 11, 
respectively.
The Universal Messaging server or Java client might fail to start with a
'java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.pcbsys.foundation.threads.fThreadPool' exception.
The issue occurs if the server or client log file has reached the configured 'RolledLogFileDepth'
at the time of initialization. The default value for 'RolledLogFileDepth' is 100 MB.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-16149 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

The performance of a Universal Messaging cluster might deteriorate when a shared-queued durable 
consumer sends event acknowledgements to a clustered realm.
The problem occurs because the master realm broadcasts event acknowledgements to all nodes in the 
cluster and then waits for the realms to process the acknowledgements.
This issue is now resolved. The Universal Messaging master realm no longer waits for the clustered 
realms to respond to an acknowledgement request.

NUM-16049 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging has been enhanced to offer bi-directional compatibility for all supported 
releases with the following Universal Messaging clients:
- Java nClient API
- JMS API
- Resource Adapter for JMS
Bi-directional compatibility enables a Universal Messaging server to work not only with clients of 
the same or lower versions, but also with clients of higher versions. For example, a Universal 
Messaging server version 10.5 can work with a client version 10.7.
This functionality enables you to upgrade or implement newer-release client components before 
upgrading the Universal Messaging server.

NUM-15961 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging returns a NullPointerException at startup.
Universal Messaging writes a NullPointerException in the nirvana.log at startup if the server tries 
to create a cluster-wide internal store while the cluster is not configured.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15920 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Migrating a Universal Messaging server instance on a Windows operating system might fail with 
the following error: "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: NUMInstanceManager.dll: Can't find dependent 
libraries".
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-15889 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Creating a channel or queue for a webMethods Cloud Container solution using the Universal Messaging 
Enterprise Manager might result in an error.
When you create a queue or channel for a Cloud Container solution on the JNDI tab in the Universal 
Messaging Enterprise Manager, Universal Messaging creates the queue or channel, but also displays 
an empty error message. Additionally, the newly created queue or channel is not listed on the 
Settings > Messaging > JNDI Settings page in Cloud Container.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-15438 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

When a Universal Messaging (UM) realm server shuts down as a result of running out of disk space, 
the server log does not give clear details about the issue.
The issue is resolved. When a realm server shuts down because of low disk space, the UM logs now 
include a warning message that indicates the percentage of free disk memory, as well as the total 
disk memory and free disk memory in megabytes. 

NUM-15404 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging might shut down with an out-of-memory error.
In some cases, the Universal Messaging realm server might shut down with OutOfMemoryError. The issue 
occurs due to a combination of factors including the slow processing of data buffers from 
multiplexed sessions.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15393 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

The Universal Messaging server shuts down with the following error message: "Multi file store, reset 
file headers due to underlying exception, key:409000."
The issue is resolved.
The multi-file store now fails when the store order is inconsistent and the error message includes 
the store path.
Also, the full stack trace with the error details is added in the wrapper log.

NUM-13204 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Session logout messages in nirvana.log does not show the milliseconds information for client session 
duration.
This issue is addressed. The  session log out messages now show the millisecond information.

NUM-8058 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

When disk scanning is enabled, Universal Messaging shuts down and does not start if the free disk 
space threshold is reached even when the remaining disk space is sufficient.
The issue is resolved. Now when you enable disk scanning, Universal Messaging behaves in the 
following way:
- The server safely shuts down with an error message when the free disk space is less than 500 MB.
- The server logs a warning message when the free disk space is less than the disk usage free 
threshold percentage.

NUM-15720 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

Possible dead lock fixed during initializing Master cluster state.
It was possible during master state initialization the JMS engine to dispatches a purge cluster-wide 
purge request, because of the dead lock the master state initialization to never finish. The 
deadlock was introduced with the "Disconnect On Cluster Failure" server-side flag feature.

NUM-15693 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

Deleting a Universal Messaging channel or queue that is configured for trace logging
might result in an exception in the server log file during server shutdown.
The issue occurs because when you delete a channel or queue, the Universal Messaging server
might not remove all resources of the trace logger for the channel or queue. In this case, when you 
stop
Universal Messaging, the server returns the following exception in the Universal Messaging server 
nirvana.log file:
"org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.AppenderLoggingException: Error writing to 
RandomAccessFile",
followed by the path to the trace log file of the deleted channel or queue.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-15643 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

Caching does not work for multi-file disk stores even when caching is enabled for the server 
instance.
The issue is resolved. By default, caching is not enabled for multi-file stores. To store events 
from a channel with multi-file store in the cache:
1/ When configuring the Universal Messaging server instance, set the EnableStoreCaching and 
EnableCaching server configurations to "true" and restart the server.
2/ When creating a channel with a multi-file store,  "Enable Caching" channel storage properties to 
"true".

NUM-15523 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

The Jacoco agent in Docker images of Universal Messaging causes conflicts with
other JVM monitoring tools.
The issue is resolved. The Jacoco agent and its configuration in the
Server_Common.conf file have been removed from the Docker images of Universal Messaging.

NUM-15431 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

The Universal Messaging realm server has performance issues when insufficient threads are assigned 
to the task scheduler.
The issue is resolved. Now the default value of "SchedulerPoolSize" is 10. After installing the fix, 
the scheduler pool size gets updated to the default value (if it was less than 10) or remains 
unchanged (if it was greater than 10).
Doc versions have also been updated with the new value.

NUM-15360 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

Sparse purging of events from a channel might cause high CPU usage in Universal Messaging
when the channel has a lot of shared durables.
Sparse purging of events from a channel might become very time-consuming when the channel has
a lot of shared durables and some of the durables are not active. This can lead to the
accumulation of many events on the durables and high CPU usage.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15348 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

UM generates several thread dumps due to Reason: Stalled task detected on this thread pool.
Fixed the code logic to calculate the task duration correctly, this issue has been resolved.

NUM-15197 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

The Universal Messaging RealmInformationCollector tool fails to run in a Docker container.
When you try to start the RealmInformationCollector in a Docker container, the tool returns
the following error: 'Universal Messaging realm server component not present in the current
installation directory (/opt/softwareag/UniversalMessaging/tools/runner/./../../..). 
So this operation is not applicable.' 
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-15113 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

The Universal Messaging nirvana.log file does not contain enough information after the migration of

Running a Universal Messaging command-line tool using the runUMTool
Tools Runner application might result in an out-of-memory exception in the JVM.
The JVM might run out of memory if the tool encounters a memory problem or leak.
The issue occurs because the runUMTool application does not have a memory limit.
The issue is resolved. Two new environment variables, UM_JAVA_MIN_MEM and UM_JAVA_MAX_MEM,
have been added. You can use them to specify the minimum and maximum memory used by the tool
you are executing.
Environment Variable Configuration Reference
Specify the minimum and maximum memory used by the command-line tool you are executing by setting 
the following variables:
- UM_JAVA_MIN_MEM=-XmsXXX, where XXX is the value of the minimum memory limit in megabytes.
The default value is "-Xms256m".
- UM_JAVA_MAX_MEM=-XmxXXX, where XXX is the value of the maximum memory limit in megabytes.
The default value is "-Xmx512m".
Specify the two environment variables in the command prompt before running the
runUMTool command:
On Windows: SET UM_JAVA_MIN_MEM=-Xms256m
On Unix: UM_JAVA_MIN_MEM=-Xms256m

NUM-14820 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

In a Universal Messaging Cluster set-up, there is no way to disallow connections on non-Master 
nodes.
Universal Messaging Active / Active cluster now supports a new mode - Replication. This mode ensures 
that non-admin client connections can be established only on the Master node, and the Slave nodes 
are used only to replicate Master's state behavior. This is similar to when the  client's 
FollowTheMaster (FTM) flag is set, so this mode can be explained as server-side FTM.
To achieve this behaviour in earlier versions of UM clients, the FTM flag has to be set for each 
client. Also this capability was available only in Java client.
To enable the new ReplicationMode a new parameter is added to Cluster Configuration, named 
ClusterMode. ClusterMode will have the following two values: 'Active' and 'Replication'
Active
    If the config is set to Active, the existing behavior for client connections will continue. The 
client-side FTM flag will be honoured by the UM cluster in this mode.
    This will be the default value for the parameter. 
Replication
        When ClusterMode is set to Replication, the client (except Admin API) connections can be 
made to only master nodes. The slave nodes will reject all client connections. Clients will 
automatically try to reconnect to the next UM server from the client's UM server url list and will 
succeed only when a Master server is hit. So clients need to be configured with all UM cluster 
server nodes. Note that the client-side FTM flag will be ignored in this mode.
If there are non-updated C# or C++ clients they will not work properly if the Replication mode is 
enabled. Before enabling Replication mode, make sure all such clients are upgraded with the latest 
client libraries. For all other clients, the Replication mode will work with existing client 
libraries.
In general, the new Replication mode might be chosen to resolve performance or cluster 
synchronisation issues where we have UM clients connected to all cluster nodes simultaneously.

NUM-14771 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

NUM-14686 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

An Universal Messaging realm joining a cluster may not recover index durable information from 
master, causing inconsistent outstanding and/or pending events on the durable. This could cause 
inability to consume events from the durable on the impacted slave.
The issue can surfice when Universal Messaging master realm does not have any oustanding and pending 
events on a durable and a slave realm is re-joining the cluster and undergoing recovery.
This issue is now resolved. Universal Messaging master realm will now unconditionally send durable 
information to realms under recovery, even if there are no outstanding and pending events on the 
durable.

Health monitor plugin introduced. This plugin adds an HTTP REST endpoint to the URL of the session 
to which the realm server is connected. This allows clients to query the current state of the realm 
server. The endpoint defines the "liveness" of the server. The plugin returns the result of the 
health checks that run on the server at periodic intervals.
AddHealthMonitorPlugin tool introduced in runUMTool. AddHelathMonitorPlugin tool can be used to add 
a health monitor plugin on a given mountpath on an HTTP based interface

NUM-12134 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

It was possible to get inconsistent store state on a cluster-wide channel\queue if TTL or 
Capacity(Honour Capacity=false) are set. This was because the expired events were cleared 
individually on each cluster nodes. Not the purging of the expired events is done cluster-wide, 
i.e. only the Master node has the authority to initiate purge of these expired events.

NUM-14428 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix8)

Create a Disconnect On Cluster Failure server-side flag which will default to false, but if set will 
override the client one: nSessionAttributes.setFollowTheMaster()
The flag which will control the Disconnect On Cluster Failure server-side behaviour is this one:
Cluster Config->DisconnectWhenNotReady.
When set to True the UM server which is goes to OfflineState will trigger a disconnect of all 
Non-Admin client connections.
This server connections disconnect will prevent further processing of user events, which makes UM's 
cluster behaviour more deterministic.
When the flag is False the default behaviour is that the decision for particular user events 
processing is made withing the particular event handlers- every handler might decide to handle the 
OfflineState situation differently, so behaviour is not always clear.
Setting the Cluster Config->DisconnectWhenNotReady to true need to be considered if customer's A/A 
Cluster setup doesn't involve using a non-cluster-wide resources within the cluster.

Publishing via a transacted JMS session may cause message loss if a failure occurs when committing 
the session and the session is not rolled back after the failure.
This issue is now resolved. If a failover happens when committing a transacted session, Universal 
Messaging JMS implementation will perform an implicit rollback of any producer transaction(s) on 
next attempt to commit the session and throw a TransactionRolledbackException to inform caller that 
they should retry the operation.

The creation of an nRealmNode instance might fail with nSessionNotConnectedException. 
When you use the Universal Messaging Admin API to connect to a Universal Messaging realm server you 
create an nRealmNode instance. If the realm server is part of a cluster that is still in the process 
of forming, the nRealmNode instance successfully connects to the server but then might disconnect 
from it. This results in an nSessionNotConnectedException error, even if the server is available.

Fixed issue where when using JS client with driver "XHR_LONGPOLL_CORS",
the server does not set appropriate headers on response.

NUM-12919 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Fixed potential HTTP session memory leak.

NUM-13219 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Fixed possible null pointer during start up, that can occur if loading durables takes more than 5 
seconds.

NUM-13203 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Multi-file store queue delivery may lock up if a consumer using a selector
is registered when the queue has at least 2 spindles but during delivery
the last spindle is removed (due to events expiring or being purged).
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-13187 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Universal Messaging NIO SSL driver may lock up in certain rare cases. 
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-13170 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

WF-14816 Transaction based metering support implemented in UM server
Metering feature. With this feature UM server can now report metrics to a SAG transaction metering 
server(LMA server). This metrics will be later on used to meter customer's usage of UM and will 
allow transaction based pricing to be applied.
Key changes:
- By default transactions reporting to LMA server is switched off. Can be enabled with a new 
Transaction enabled license. If not such license is applied UM will collect the metrics, but will 
not report them. Metrics will be only logged in log level "Info".
- To report to LMA server UM use the newly developed LMA agent, which is a library run in UM's 
server runtime. It will take care of caching and actual reporting of the UM's metrics to LMA 
server. UM's responsibility is to feed the LMA agent with its metrics.
- UM will report metrics on 10mins intervals to the LMA agent. Reported metrics will be reported as 
deltas from the previous reporting.
- UM server fix has now dependency to the LMA agent fix to ensure that it will be always available. 
- Metrics reported:
  BytesIn - number of the published events bytes
  BytesOut - number of the consumed events bytes
  MessagesIn - number of the published messages
  MessagesOut - number of the consumed messages
  ConnectionCount- number of user connections established for the period 
- Metrics collected from connections established by Integration Server will not be reported the the 
LMA server. This is done becouse the operations made by these connections are already metered by IS 
as part of a high level transaction.
!!! NOTE: LMA agent has its own license, and if Transactions metering is enabled in UM's license, UM 
will also require and the LMA agent's license to be installed. If LMA agent fails to initialise UM 
server will not start and the exact reason can be found in the UM server's log: "Error while 
initialising LMA metering agent". Please contact SAG's customer support on how to resolve the 
issue.

NUM-13084 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Universal Messaging server now supports configuring queue filter index time-to-live using 
'QUEUE_FILTER_INDEX_TTL' system property.
The property specifies time-to-live value for queue filter indices in milliseconds, if not specified 
default of 1 hour is used.
If set to 0, the queue filter index is removed from cache once it is no longer used (no active 
consumer uses such filter).
Implementation note: The Universal Messaging server will build and maintain an index with events 
matching each unique queue consumer filter and cache it in memory.
The index will be removed if it is not used for longer than specified TTL value. This configuration 
applies to all queues in the server.
A lower TTL value is recommended when consumers' filters are changing frequently and new consumers 
rarely or never specify the same filter twice.
A higher TTL value is recommended when filters are expected to be re-used, for example when newly 
registered consumers use filters of previous consumers.

NUM-13032 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Universal Messaging master realm may create a queue subscription for a slave realm while the realm 
is being disconnected from the cluster. The master realm will eventually fail to dispatch events to 
this subscription with a NullPointerException.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-12982 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Fixed the following potential errors that may occur when MQTT is used.
a. nChannelDoesNotExistException.
b. NullPointerExceptions.
c. Various payload mismatch errors in regards to MQTT retained events. 

NUM-12924 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Universal Messaging does not update the license expiration date properly.
If you add a new invalid license for Universal Messaging before the old one has
expired, the license manager keeps the expiration date of the old license, and
the server does not shut down within 30 minutes due to an invalid or missing
license.
The issue is resolved. 

NUM-12448 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

UM running high memory.
The issue was due to lot number if inflight documents causing delay in memory clean and in some 
cases caching of events was also done wrongly.
This issue is resolved, now event caching is not done in case store caching is disabled.

NUM-11236 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Fixed the following potential errors that may occur when MQTT is used.
a. nChannelDoesNotExistException.
b. NullPointerExceptions.
c. Various payload mismatch errors in regards to MQTT retained events. 

NUM-12860 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Fixed an issue, where when using transactional publish to slave we could hit a race condition server 
side, which may cause stream corruption.

NUM-12762 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Fixed a problem that could cause a queue delivery to get stuck when sending events that have TTL 
set.

NUM-12743 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

When Universal Messaging server is migrating a pre-10.5 queue store, it will fail the migration and 
shut down the server if the queue and/or internal queue commit store contain events with one and 
the same originalTransactionEID.
This issue is now resolved. Universal Messaging server will assume events with same 
originalTransactionEID to be duplicates and will ignore them, only logging a warning:
QUEUE MIGRATION> Not moving event with EID=<eid> to its original position at 
EID=<originalTransactionEID> on queue <queue>. Queue already contains an event with such EID.

NUM-12728 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

For remote joins, the source node may change, but the destination side may still hold a connection 
to the previous node/realm.  This has the unfortunate side effect of leaving queued events on the 
source channel, since the destination side is now acknowledging events on a former node. We need to 
reset this behavior by always referring to the incoming connection, since this new connection will 
always be up to date (i.e. always point to the source node).

NUM-12725 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Performance degradation is observed when publishing to a channel with one or more shared-queued 
durables.

NUM-12693 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Channel ACL values in the Enterprise Manager and ACL values in the exported
document representing a realm do not match.
When you create a channel in the Enterprise Manager, the default user is granted
all ACL permissions for the channel. However, when you export the realm to 
an XML file, the value representing the Named permission is set to "false". 
The issue is resolved.

NUM-12618 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Some log entries were present in nirvana.log file with FATAL log level while they are kind of 
informative so most of these are now moved into LOG level. 

NUM-12597 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

When removing a shared durable or serial durable subscriber from a channel, Universal Messaging may 
throw an exception "com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nUserNotSubscribedException: User is not subscribed 
to the channel:RemoveSubscribe" which is returned as a response to the client application even 
though the subscriber is disconnected correctly.

NUM-12581 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Universal Messaging server will fail to process an event if it has an invalid Google protocol buffer 
dictionary set and event has to be filtered.
This issue is now resolved. If Universal Messaging server fails to decode a Google protocol buffer 
event, for example due to event payload not matching the protocol definition, the event will still 
be processed by the server, meaning that the server will be able to store  the event. However if 
Google protocol buffer event filtering is enabled, any subscribers which specify a selector might 
not receive this event.

NUM-12526 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Refactored nLocalQueueJoinEventHandler's restart() method which was containing unnecessary calls.	 

NUM-12284 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Exclusive durable outstanding events is returning the number of events that are there on the channel 
instead on the durable. This is now fixed

NUM-12722 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix1)

The individual JMS purge functionality is now enabled by default and the 
JMSEngineIndividualPurgeEnabled server configuration is now removed.
Now the jms individual purge can be disabled only with system property on server restart.
The server system property is: com.softwareag.um.server.store.JMSEngineIndividualPurgeEnabled (true 
by default). Set it to false to disable the JMS individual purge.

NUM-12569 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix1)


NUM-12543 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix1)

Protobuf event dictionary is broken with Older clients.
This issue was due to old version event factory was not reading the event correctly, Issue has been 
resolved.

NUM-12430 (NUM_10.5_wM_RealmServer_Fix1)

The Universal Messaging server sends a duplicate unsubscribe cluster event when unsubscribing a 
consumer in a cluster.
This issue is now resolved.


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*)Since 10.5 Fix 6 Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.
(*) Starting with 10.5 Fix 16, Universal Messaging provides updated versions of security libraries with 
the Universal Messaging realm server fixes, if any of these libraries has been updated. You can find 
the libraries in the UniversalMessaging\lib folder.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.
