NUM-18456 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix20)

When you export a realm configuration in an xml file using Enterprise Manager, Universal Messaging 
wrongly appends "@" at the end of a join destination.
The issue occurs when the source channel in a join has a namespace.
This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-18198 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix19)

The Top Channel Usage tab in Enterprise Manager does not display the rate of consumed and published 
events.
Instead, the tab displays only the total number of consumed and published events.
The issue is resolved. The tab now displays both the rate and total number of consumed and published 
events.

NUM-17565 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix17)

Creation of an interface when there is an existing interface with the same adapter and port was 
allowed.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-17502 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix17)

Protobuf descriptor missing after channel edit
When editing the storage properties of a store, the protobuf properties might get lost in the 
process.
The issue is resolved

NUM-17698 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix16)

Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager might not update the Filter field for a durable.
When you edit the filter for a durable, Enterprise Manager might not display the updated value in 
the Filter field in the Durables table. The correct value is displayed only after you restart 
Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16219 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix13)

Top tab has been updated to display more channel details

NUM-16049 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix12)

Universal Messaging has been enhanced to offer bi-directional compatibility for all supported 
releases with the following Universal Messaging clients:
- Java nClient API
- JMS API
- Resource Adapter for JMS
Bi-directional compatibility enables a Universal Messaging server to work not only with clients of 
the same or lower versions, but also with clients of higher versions. For example, a Universal 
Messaging server version 10.5 can work with a client version 10.7.
This functionality enables you to upgrade or implement newer-release client components before 
upgrading the Universal Messaging server.

NUM-15236 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix12)

The Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fails to perform some operations
because it uses non-admin connections to the Universal Messaging server for those operations.
When the Universal Messaging server is configured to not allow non-admin client connections,
the Enterprise Manager fails to perform the operations that use non-admin connections to the server.
For example, the problem happens after you set the ClusterMode parameter to 'Replication', which
means Universal Messaging does not allow non-admin connections to cluster nodes other than the 
master node.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-14901 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix11)

Exporting or importing a realm configuration into XML results in missing or incomplete joins 
details.
When exporting or importing realm configurations from Enterprise Manager or using the "nexportrealm" 
or "nimportrealm" code samples, one of the following issues occurs:
- The exported XML file does not include any information about the remote joins.
- The joins entries in the exported XML file do not include the details of the remote realm, which 
incorrectly represents the join as local.
- The information about the remote joins does not get imported.
The issues are now resolved.

NUM-15315 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix10)

The Enterprise Manager for Universal Messaging might stop responding when you click a queue to view 
its status.
Such a situation might also happen when you try to view the status of a channel or a durable in the 
Enterprise Manager.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-15163 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix10)

Universal Messaging writes messages to already rolled nirvana.log files.
The problem occurs because Universal Messaging does not use the correct logging framework. The 
server uses the default logging framework instead of the additionally specified Log4J2 framework.
The issue is resolved. Now all packages use the correct logger for the package level.

NUM-14794 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix10)

Newly added servers to an existing Universal Messaging cluster cannot establish
inter-realm communication between each other.
In Enterprise Manager, when you add more than one realm server to an existing Universal Messaging 
cluster at the same time, the newly added servers cannot establish
inter-realm communication between each other.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-13647 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix8)

Importing the interfaces are based on ports uniqueness based. nsp and nsps imports work when the 
aliases are similar. It creates new aliases with new ports and work. But due to some reason, the 
nhp and nhps didn't work when the aliases are similar. But they work when the aliases are 
different. 
When an interface with the same host and port is present, a new interface gets added and then the 
status is changes to Error. 
These issues are solved.

NUM-14001 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix7)

Enterprise manager UI is not rendered correctly in 10.5 Fix 6 due to missing classes in the packaged 
binary.
The issue is now resolved. 

NUM-13720 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix7)

Fixed edge case where durable would not show in EM tree.

NUM-11708 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix7)

Make stalled task timeout and the thread dump configurable.
Thread pool monitoring is used to detect stalled task at fixed time interval of 60 second. This 
timeout has been made configurable to allow user to specify the timeout for stalled and slow task. 
Also user can now configure the thread dump interval.

NUM-13431 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix6)

The password was not being prompted when EM tries to connect to realm by opening the configuration 
file, for realms with basic authentication enabled.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-13426 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix6)

* Added "Connections" field in Consumer Info panel for Queue to show number of Consumers connected 
to Queue.
* Added "Connections" field in Durable details panel for Durable to show number of Connections to 
Durable.
* Removed Persistent & Clustered labels in nDurablePanel.
* Removed Cluster wide, Persistent,Is Serial, Is Shared columns from Durable panel of Channel and 
added Durable Type, Filter, Last Read and Write time columns.

NUM-13442 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix5)

While running multiple EM it quite difficult to figure out which version EM is running.
This issue is resolved now.

This issue has been resolved.

NUM-13310 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix5)

In Enterprise Manager, at many places memory units was being displayed as M.
This issue is resolved now and memory units are now changed to MB.

NUM-13107 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix3)

Enterprise Manager does not show the time unit while displaying the TTL value for queues and 
channels. 
This issue has been resolved.

NUM-13047 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix3)

The list of clients displayed in the Connections tab of the Monitoring panel in Universal Messaging 
Enterprise Manager for a realm do not display the client build number.
This issue is now addressed. A new column, 'build number' is added in the table that shows the 
client information. This column shows the build number of the client API. 

NUM-12693 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix2)

Channel ACL values in the Enterprise Manager and ACL values in the exported
document representing a realm do not match.
When you create a channel in the Enterprise Manager, the default user is granted
all ACL permissions for the channel. However, when you export the realm to 
an XML file, the value representing the Named permission is set to "false". 
The issue is resolved.

NUM-12539 (NUM_10.5_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

"Durable Status" was showing as "Queue Status" in EM durable panel. This has been fixed now


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*)Since 10.5 Fix 6 Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.
(*) Starting with 10.5 Fix 16, Universal Messaging provides updated versions of security libraries with 
the Universal Messaging realm server fixes, if any of these libraries has been updated. You can find 
the libraries in the UniversalMessaging\lib folder.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.
