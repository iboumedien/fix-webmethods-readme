WST-6234 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

When users try to create a connection for 
Salesforce Marketing Cloud on Integration
Server version 10.5 and CloudStreams, the 
following error message is displayed:
"Missing required fields - Authorization Server URL. 
Authentication Server URL."

This issue is observed because of a change that was 
implemented as a part of WST-5261 fix.
The Authorization Server URL and Authentication 
Server URL fields were shown with
generic endpoint values in OAuth Access Token 
generation modal window.

The Authentication Server URL and Authorization 
Server URL are required fields. The OAuth Access
Token generation modal window fetches default values 
configured in the connection group for a
connector. However, a few connectors failed to 
declare the URL values in the connection group,
due to which, the input values for the Authentication 
Server URL and Authorization Server URL fields
were left empty.

This issue is resolved. We now skip the validation for 
Authorization Server URL and Authentication
Server URL fields. The Generate Access Token modal 
handles validation to the fields during the access token
generation.


WST-6483 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

Fix for Performance metric events are not pushed 
to CLS_METRICS_EVENT table when enabled in Database Configuration.

While using a connector, when users try to enable 
'Publish performance metrics to database',
the following error message is displayed: 
"Error while running 
com.softwareag.pg.pgmen.processors.PerformanceDataDeployer task.
Cause: java.lang.NullPointerException null 
java.lang.NullPointerException: null."

This issue is not observed in the Standalone 
Integration Server setup but is reproducible in the 
Clustered Integration Server setup 
while enabling 'Publish performance metrics to database' with the 
WmMicrosoftAzureStorageProvider package installed in the environment.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5821 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

The RetryCount property in Listener Error Recovery is reset 
immediately for every successful response.

After a successful meta handshake, the retry count is reset to zero.
However,if meta subscription fails, the error recovery 
process starts again. Due to this,
each time the retry count is set to zero, CloudStreams 
attempts to recover error continuously, even though the maximum number of retry 
attempts should be up to 3.

CloudStreams now ensures that the listener is disabled after the
maximum retry attempts has reached.


WST-6077 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

Error message displayed while importing the 
corrupt zip archive package is corrected and clean up of 
package is handled.

While importing a ZIP package, if the package is not 
in a correct format or is corrupted, 
CloudStreams displayed an incorrect error message.

Furthermore, even if the package was not successfully 
imported, it appeared in Service Development, 
which is not the expected behavior, and 
cleanup did not happen accordingly.

The issues are now resolved.


WST-6275 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

When a listener encounters the "403::Unknown Client" error from 
Salesforce,the listener gets disabled intermittently.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5369 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

The Session Timeout (min) option is disabled if the Session 
Management parameter is set to auto.

This issue is resolved.


WST-6067 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

During course of non-recoverable errors, listeners were getting disabled.
Persistence into node.ndf directly, in CIS servers is architecturally invalid.
Changes were made to avoid this and only stop bayeuxClient, 
which is sufficient to avoid repeated retries with Salesforce streaming server


WST-6168 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

Fix for Deployment issue with Cloudstreams Assets using 
the “Salesforce CRM REST” connector in version 51.

While deploying CloudStreams assets by using repository-based 
deployment for the “Salesforce CRM REST” connector in version 51, 
the following exception is displayed:
"The cloud service '*Service_Name*' needs to be migrated first 
before running the update".
Since the source and the target are the same, Migration is not 
required. Hence, this is an unexpected behavior.

This behavior is observed when the connector XML file has 
style="REST"' for resource(example Query, Query-All).
During this time, the flow flags it for Migration.

This behavior was not observed earlier because the 
“Salesforce CRM REST” connector in all
versions had 'style="SOAP"', which did not flag for Migration.

This issue is now resolved.


WST-6426 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

For a few Salesforce errors and authentication-related issues, 
it was observed that, the listener was disconnected.

This issue is resolved. Scenarios like these are now handled 
by providing an error handling
mechanism where the listener will retry up to five times before 
getting disconnected.


WST-5793 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

While enabling a Listener, if users provide an invalid Replay ID, 
the CloudStreams page becomes unresponsive for sometime 
after which the Listener gets enabled.

CloudStreams now ensures that the Listener is disabled if an 
invalid Replay ID is provided.

This issue is resolved.


WST-6173 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

The context URI has optional parameters apiType and storeCode 
which doesn't require an input during execution. The target URI 
has these optional parameters removed but has trailing and leading slashes. 
Replacing the trailing and leading slashes with single slash solves the issue

The request URI in the Magento connector has optional parameters 
"apiType" and "storeCode", which
can be empty during service execution. CloudStreams target URI has 
these optional parameters removed but has trailing and leading slashes remains. 
This causes the OAuth signature to
miscalculate with redundant slashes in the context URI but during
the execution, CloudStreams removes the extra slashes in the URI.
When backend calculates the signature
at the server end, it throws an invalid signature error. 
This is because the OAuth includes the extra
slashes in the URI during signature calculation.

This issue is resolved. We have now replaced multiple trailing 
and leading slashes in the context URI with a
single slash.


WST-6245 (WST_10.5_Fix32)

While creating a cloud connector service for the Oracle FSCM connector, 
when a user tries to retrieve the list of all available operations 
by clicking the operation listing icon,
the following error message is displayed in the server.log: 
"Exception while populating
the abstract definition for operation: InvoiceService. Details: 
createInterfaceLine java.lang.NullPointerException: null"

This issue is resolved.

WST-6200 (WST_10.5_Fix31)

A new input field named "customFields" is introduced to add data that is required
to refresh the token or pass global connection fields used in API calls.

This provision allows users to pass custom inputs in scenarios where the refresh
implementation requires inputs other than those defined by the specification.

Custom fields prefixed with "oauth_v20.cx." will be made available to the pipeline
of the implementing service.

WST-6174 (WST_10.5_Fix31)

Oracle FSCM connector's WSDL cache key does not contain connector version.

Oracle FSCM connector caches WSDL while creating first cloud service for 
any given service. During the cloud service creation, the WSDL is being 
fetched dynamically and cached into the WSDL cache. CloudStreams engine 
builds the cache key by appending connection alias, service name, and the 
connector version appended by an underscore.

This issue is resolved.

WST-6010 (WST_10.5_Fix31)

While generating a microservice runtime template, CloudStreams connections are
not included in the 'application.properties' file.

The CloudStreams connections that are imported from another system are not included
in the template because of password retrieval issues. The passman store of the current system
fails to have an entry for the passman handles of the imported connection.

CloudStreams now includes a dummy value for such password fields.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5417 (WST_10.5_Fix31)

The expires_in value returned from Adobe was in milliseconds. But according to 
OAuth specification the expiration time unit should be in seconds. Adobe has 
fixed this and now the expires_in value is coming in seconds. This required a 
change in the conversion of units. Now the CloudStreams handles all expires_in 
value as seconds according to specification.

WST-5741 (WST_10.5_Fix31)

Input request headers in service dispatcher bridge are re-overridden using 
custom metadata stored in the service node (REST dispatcher metadata).

Fixed this issue by stopping cross override of input headers.

WST-6036 (WST_10.5_Fix31)

CloudStreams fails to cache WSDL during operation listing for public WSDLs.

CloudStreams supports Dynamic Service Creation for a given WSDL. During this
process, CloudStreams first validates, downloads, and then caches the WSDL
and, given the operation, later generates the document types dynamically.
If the WSDL is publicly available, the caching does not happen, causing the
performance to slow down in the first step.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-5885 (WST_10.5_Fix30)
Infinite timeout during SSL Handshake

It was observed that, sometimes, during a SSL handshake, 
a few threads got stuck indefinitely.

CloudStreams now ensures that the socket timeout 
and connection timeout is set in an orderly
manner.

This issue is resolved.

Please note below behaviour:

1. We need to note that, before the CCS execution, 
sometimes, token would need to be refreshed, 
depending on the connection type. So, in this case, 2 things happen:
    a. token refresh
    b. CCS execution
2. In both the above scenarios, the value of connectTimeout 
is printed in the logs.
3. Please note that, for few connectors (eg. Google), 
the token refresh logic is customized, in the sense, that, 
there is a service which depends on pub.client.http, 
for performing the refresh.
4. Following is a detailed explanation, taking into consideration 
-, for example - Google connector.
5. With regard to Google Cloud Storage connector, in both the scenarios, 
the value of connectTimeout printed in the logs will differ.
6. Google Cloud Storage connector, uses a custom refresh token service 
(wm.cloudstreams.google.cloudstorage.refreshToken:customRefreshToken), 
which inturn uses pub.client.http service.
7. And for pub.client.http service, the connection timeout is 
dependent on a watt property, 'watt.net.timeout', 
which is configurable.
8. So, during the refresh token, value of connectTimeout 
will be referred from watt.net.timeout value and that gets 
printed in the first occurrence of connectTimeout in the logs.
9. During the CCS execution, the connectionTimeout 
configured within the connection, is referred, 
so, that value gets printed in the second occurrence of 
connectTimeout in the logs.


WST-5911 (WST_10.5_Fix30)
Oracle HCM - Getting  "ERROR_INVOKING_CLOUD_SERVICE: null" 
error for create and update TalentPersonProfiles BO 

Empty content with GZIP content encoding causes 
NullPointerException in response.

No bytes in the response content caused this issue. 
Passing empty bytes to GZIP
stream causes NullPointerException while reading. 
Input needs to be sanitized based on
the content encoding and content length in the response.

We have now passed valid input stream for response handling.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5148 (WST_10.5_Fix30)
Getting error like "node name already in use" 
every time user enables a connection of any provider

Getting "node name already in use" error when user 
enables a connection or listener.

The issue was due to location reload which resubmits 
the form again (two form submission).
The form submission is changed to jQuery form submit 
instead of location reload.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5235 (WST_10.5_Fix30)
Add registered standard headers and claims in OAuth JWT group

In webMethods CloudStreams Server, standard headers and 
claims, registered under the JWT specification RFC7519, 
are now added to the CloudStreams OAuth JWT
connection group.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5261 (WST_10.5_Fix30)
Unhide authorization token URL and authentication token URL in OAuth groups

In webMethods CloudStreams Server, the URL fields of 
Authorization Server and Authentication Server are hidden with fixed endpoints.
 
This issue is resolved. Now, the URL fields of Authorization Server and
Authentication Server are shown with generic endpoint values in OAuth
Access Token generation modal window. You can edit the values of these fields,
if required.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5883 (WST_10.5_Fix29)

The GET operation in Google Cloud Storage fails with an error "400 Bad Request"
when "enableCompression" is set to "true".

When "enableCompression" is set to "true", GZIP encryption start and end bytes were
sent in the Request Body which is not an expected behavior.

CloudStreams now skips the Request Body for GET requests and avoids empty Content Body.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5599 (WST_10.5_Fix29)

For any resource, mappings that are returned can vary based on connectionType. 
It is expected that right set of mappings are returned for a specific authentication 
scheme based on the input provided in connectionType.
 
However, while initializing the connectionType, if the providerName is not provided
in the input, mappings for the default connectionType are returned.
 
This issue is resolved.

WST-5857 (WST_10.5_Fix29)

Whenever a connection for a particular service was invoked, 
the following log message was repeatedly generated at the Info level:
"Detected the session as alive for the connection \"" + 
cloudConnectionDataNode.getNodeName() + "\" and will be
expired in " + sessionManager.getSessionExpiryTime()".

This log message has now been moved from the Info level to the Debug level.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5609 (WST_10.5_Fix28)

Few back-ends expect percent-encoding of reserved characters in the URI.
When a URI-based parameter value, containing a reserved character, has a special
meaning (a "reserved purpose") and the URI scheme has a different meaning or purpose
of the reserved character, then the reserved character must be percent-encoded. An
error occurs if an URI with a reserved character is not handled properly.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5568 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

ESB Services were not getting invoked after arrival of events due to an internal error.
The error is fixed and ESB Services are now correctly invoked like processors.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5132 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

Vulnerable version of jetty jars from CloudStreams have been removed from Cloudstreams package.
And with this change, CloudStreams runtime will refer to secure versions of jetty jars bundled with IS.


WST-5583 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

The lookup details provided in the description of a REST connector for any resource was
not added to Node-hints of the Cloud connector service. The resource metadata was
not available in the implementation where Node-hints for Cloud connector service were created.

We have updated the implementation to provide resource metadata while creating
Node-hints for Cloud connector service.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5188 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

INVALID_SESSION_ID error observed during parallel execution of Salesforce OAuth based
APIs using CloudStreams connector services.

While starting multiple parallel executions of Salesforce OAuth-based API using
CloudStreams connector services, a few executions fail with INVALID_SESSION_ID.

This error occurs when the OAuth access token is refreshed and the new access token is
available for the execution thread that uses the connection which triggered the token
refresh flow.

The remaining connections in the pool are oblivious to this updated token. As a result,
executions that operate with a connection other than the one that serviced the
refreshing flow fails as they continue to operate with the older OAuth access token.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5234 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

CloudStreams Server fails to execute "Get Object" or "Put Object" 
operations of AWS S3, when bucket name is the same as object name.

When the AWS S3 bucket name specified is the same as object name for AWS S3
"Get Object" or "Put Object" operations(e.g, bucket name is "cstreams" and object 
name is "test/cstreams/logo.png")
the underlying operation fails with the error "Location header is not found for the 
redirected response. org.apache.http.ProtocolException: Location header is not 
found for the redirected response. "

This issue is resolved.

CloudStreams Server is now capable of successfully handling "Get Object" or "Put Object" 
operations of AWS S3 with bucket name same as object name


WST-5305 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

Added log for the input pipeline at trace level. This helps to debug
input data related issues during execution of operation.

WST-5307  (WST_10.5_Fix27)

CloudStreams Server does not handle response content of type 
json for response code 300 correctly.

CloudStreams Server fails to extract response content of type json 
for status code 300. As a result, the response for an upsert operation 
which results in status code 300 is not displayed correctly in the signature

This issue is fixed.
 
The response content of type json for status code 300 is displayed 
corrrectly against the signature.

WST-5301  (WST_10.5_Fix27)

MSR template does not show encrypted values for the encrypt fields of auth groups other than credential group.
We have added support for adding the encrypted values for all the auth group's encrypt fields into template.

This issue resolved.

WST-5472 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

The connection node used for creating cloud service can be deleted at anytime. 
And inline connection properties does not show if the connection is not available.

To overcome the dependency on the connection node, added check for connection existence. 
If node does not exist then get the connection configuration from ConnectorID.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5377 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

Workday WSDL validation stops cloud service-creation-flow if any operation is missing
in WSDL.

When you list the operation while creating the cloud service, the CloudStreams engine
performs a certain set of validation in terms of containment of the interactions in
the WSDL file.
For the given functional area it checks if all the interactions listed in that
functional area are present in the corresponding WSDL file or not. If the validation
fails, then the cloud service-creation-flow stops and you cannot create a cloud service.

The issue is now resolved.

WST-5484 (WST_10.5_Fix27)

In webMethods CloudStreams Server, the model reader object and the resource name
are set incorrectly in the login sequence.

This isssue is resolved. Now, the correct values are updated in the login
sequence.


WST-5292 (WST_10.5_Fix26)

The parameters with mapping always considers the mapped value and ignores pipeline data irrespective 
of isFixed property.

For mappings the isFixed property is not handled at runtime and because this always considered mapped 
value and ignored pipeline values.But when we set isFixed=false and if there is a value in the pipeline 
for respective parameter then consider the pipeline value.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5424 (WST_10.5_Fix26)

Once the Salesforce connector was updated with errorhandler group, errorhandler was not getting registered 
for existing listeners assets. With this, a discrepancy was observed in the UI that errorhandler was enabled 
for the listener. This fix ensures that errorhandler is registered correctly for the existing listener assets.

WST-5303 (WST_10.5_Fix26)

The env variables are not substituted for the CloudStreams connection properties.

The values retrieved from the application.properties file should be processed further to retrieve values from 
environment variables. Dynamic variables processor provides the utility to fetch values from env properties.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5430 (WST_10.5_Fix26)

Deployment of packages with Cloudstreams components are failing. 

Deployment of connector services without any changes specified in variable substitution will not log an error 
any more in target server.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5298 (WST_10.5_Fix26)

The content-type header shows as optional in the resources though it is provided in the swagger specification.

In CloudStreams while creating the resources from swagger specification the content-type header should be set as required.

This issue resolved.

WST-5337 (WST_10.5_Fix26)

Listener debug logs are not enabled even after logging settings are updated

The logging settings are applied at the time of enabling a listener.
If user modifies logging settings after enabling listener, the logging settings do not get honoured.
This fix will ensure that logging settings will get honored instantaneously.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5252 (WST_10.5_Fix25)

In the putOject and getObject operations for AWS S3, an object name with special 
characters is not allowing and throws the error "SignatureDoesNotMatch" .

To overcome this issue we have implemented encoding for the path during canonical request creation.

This issue is resolved.

WST-5204 (WST_10.5_Fix24)


User cannot access or create updated workday operation dynamically as SOAP
operation generation by-design adheres to a specific version of WSDL.
 
CloudStreams now supports the creation of workday operations dynamically using
Designer. Users can create workday operations dynamically by pointing to a WSDL
hosting web URL or by uploading the workday WSDL file locally. As the user has an
option to feed workday WSDL file per operation, so the user can point to an
updated WSDL and any update to the WSDL are selected automatically.
 
This issue is resolved.

WST-5169 (WST_10.5_Fix24)

Unable to execute the service if there is a failure while refreshing the token.

When the token refresh fails, service execution was restricted.

This issue is resolved. Now, if a failure occurs during the token refresh, the
service is executed with an existing token in the system.

WST-4910 (WST_10.5_Fix21)

CloudStreams now supports lookups for connection fields while configuring a connection using CloudStreams 
Administrator page. This capability improves the connectionconfiguration experience for the CloudStreams 
Administrator user. Using this feature,for a lookup enabled field, an Administrator user can select from a 
list of values retrieved directly from the SaaS provider instead of manually entering the value,which assumes 
pre-knowledge of the correct value supported by the SaaS provider.Using this feature a CloudStreams Developer 
user can specify a connection field to list values using an SaaS API.  
 
The feature allows CloudStreams Administrator to optionally click on "Load" button to get list of options available for the lookup field.



WST-4964 (WST_10.5_Fix20)

CloudStreams does not encode space character withing a resource URI.

This issue occurs when user executes a connector service which has space character in the resource URI.
Example: /pubapi/v1/fs-content/Shared/test2/Egnyte Logo.png

This issue is fixed.

WST-4978 (WST_10.5_Fix20)

Listeners unable to reconnect after the connection timeout.
After meta_connect receives the timeout, the listener stops. 
However,to maintain connectivity with Streaming Server, 
CloudStreams listener performs are-handshake 
after the timeout of meta_connect.

This issue is resolved.

WST-4754 (WST_10.5_Fix20)

CloudStreams does not support text/plain content from 
service provider when tried to access via
a virtual service.
If there is a service provider which respond in text/plain format
and if some user tries to invoke that service using CloudStreams 
virtual service framework then user will not get 
that service's response.

 This issue is resolved now.

WST-4887 (WST_10.5_Fix20)

User gets an error when trying to filter out the event entries using either
the Life cycle event or the transaction event under the Event tab.

This issue is fixed now.

WST-5033 (WST_10.5_Fix20)

JWT custom meta fields are missing in the dynamic connection
Custom meta fields were not allowed to be overriden in the CloudStreams runtime.
CloudStreams now allows custom meta fields to be overridable connection fields.

WST-5044 (WST_10.5_Fix20)

Rest application operation execution is breaking when we enable dynamic configuration
 in existing custom project of wmic preprod and prod


WST-5016 (WST_10.5_Fix19)

Unable to create account for Servicenow connector

WST-4730 (WST_10.5_Fix19)

Workday: While uploading invalid XML file as WSDL file, error message is not correct

WST-4921 (WST_10.5_Fix18)

Customer was unable to generate access token for Salesforce 
since the Redirect URI was not editable and we did not support
Open ID integration,With this fix CloudStreams now allows 
you to edit the Redirect URI, Authorization Endpoint and 
Token Endpoint. The changes will now allow the customer 
to do open id integration.



WST-4965 (WST_10.5_Fix17)

The Inline Load of Business Object consumes time while
creating Cloud Connector Service for Coupa.
This issue occurs due to the inline loading
of the business object for Coupa.
It consumes 15 mins delay for few doctypes 
due to multiple levels of nesting of the objects.
This issue is resolved. Now, CloudStreams provides dynamic 
loading of business
objects for Coupa which consumes only few seconds.


WST-4941(WST_10.5_Fix16)

Operation execution fails in case of dynamic connection
configuration is done in Integration Cloud.
CloudStreams does not support project handling
for operation execution in case of dynamic connection
configuration is enable on Integration Cloud.

This issue is fixed.

WST-4883 (WST_10.5_Fix15)

User is not able to execute few SAP S4 Hana cloud services.

Few SAP S4 Hana service calls needs CSRF token to be sent.
To send CSRF token CloudStreams do a hidden fetch call and get the CSRF
token and then embeds that token in the real service call.
This process fails if the connection is not reused across these two
separate service calls. Now with current fix, CloudStreams retain
and re-use the same connection (thus the same CSRF token) for these scenarios.

This issue is resolved now. 


WST-4839 (WST_10.5_Fix13)

Added postgresql scripts for create and drop tables.
We added this scripts as a seperate fix not part of WmCloudStreams fix.
So if you are using postgresql database, you need to select
"CloudStreams Database 10.5 Fix 1" under Database Configuration group.

WST-4660 (WST_10.5_Fix3)
Salesforce upgrade from 42 to 44 is failing on Integration Cloud 
SAGLive environment. 

Upgrade utility processes all the CloudStreams assets in the package 
for all the application. Since in the SAGLive environment there 
were few assets for which custom REST applications were deleted. 
Hence upgrade was failing while processing the assets of custom 
REST applications. 

This issue is resolved. Now we process the assets only for the 
desired application, for example: In this case it will process 
only Salesforce connectors assets.

WST-4586 (WST_10.5_Fix3)
Listener error handler service is invoked when 
configuration disabled. 

Listener invokes the error handler service when 
it encounters an error or an exception if the 
configuration is set to false. 

This issue is resolved. Now, The listener error 
handler does not invoke the service when it is set 
to false.

WST-4548 (WST_10.5_Fix3)
CloudStreams does not restrict redirection requests to 
a locally hosted Integration Server installation causing 
a security vulnerability. 

A web server can be configured such that for a given 
HTTP resource, the response can be redirected to the same 
local host where the Integration Server is hosted, or any 
private IP address. If you create a CloudStreams connector 
to access the above HTTP resource, and as CloudStreams connectors 
redirect all redirection requests in general, the configured redirection 
response may get access to any resource in the Integration Server. 
This may cause serious security vulnerabilities. 

This issue is resolved.


WST-4583(WST_10.5_Fix2)
Any parameter of type string that is defined in a multipart resource 
takes a different hint while trying to run it.

If the parameter is required it shows as an optional parameter and 
vice versa while running the cloud connector service.

This is issue is resolved.



8.0 Installation

Step 1: Install using the Software AG Update Manager. For 
instructions on using Update Manager, see "Using the Software 
AG Update Manager" at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: If you have migrated your connector services from a version
prior to CloudStreams 9.7 and impacted by WST-2213, and you are
yet to run the migration utility as suggested in WST-2213, go to
Step 2, else skip Step 2. If you have created your connector 
services with a CloudStreams 9.7 or later version, you do not 
need to run the migration utility

Note: As part of WST-5204, the SoftwareAG-IS-CloudStreams.xml config file has an 
impact.
 
If the user has modified "Persistent configuration of events for 
duplicate detection" or any additional changes in below config file 
SoftwareAG-IS-CloudStreams.xml, located in:
<IS-installation-dir>\IntegrationServer
\instances\default\packages\WmCloudStreams\config\resources\caching directory.
 
Ensure to  take a backup of existing SoftwareAG-IS-CloudStreams.xml file.
Also, post WST_10.5_Fix24 installation, update the config values referring to the
backup file.


Step 2: Run the CloudStreams migration utility
(pub.cloudstreams.migration:migrate) to migrate your old
CloudStreams artifacts to the latest version.
For more information on the migration utility, see the 
Integration Server upgrade section in the "Upgrading Software 
AG Products" guide.

Step 3: In Integration Server, under Settings > Extended > 
Extended Settings, add "watt.net.ssl.client.useJSSE=true" to 
use the latest TLS versions.
Note: Restart Integration Server after applying the above 
property. In most cases, only this property is required for 
SaaS providers like Salesforce.
In some cases, where you want to force usage of any other 
protocols, for example, SSLv3 or a particular version of TLS 
properties, use the following properties:
 - watt.net.jsse.client.enabledProtocols
 - watt.net.ssl.client.handshake.minVersion
See the webMethods Integration Server Administrator Guide 
for the desired values of these properties.

Step 4: For a few SaaS back ends, the underlying JVM trust store 
may have the required certificates and you may not need to 
follow this step. But for back ends which have certificates 
that are not part of the JVM trust store, create and apply a 
new trust store in Integration Server with the certificates 
of the SaaS back end. This is a standard practice 
for setting up secure exchange of certificates. If the trust 
store is not present, in such cases, certificate related 
errors will appear.
To set up secure exchange of certificates, create a JKS trust 
store with the certificates of the SaaS back end. The trust 
store should contain all the certificates present in the 
certificate chain. Apply the trust store in the Integration 
Server administration page at the "Security > Keystore" 
section and use that trust store alias in your CloudStreams 
connection in the "Trust Store" field.
To know more about creating trust stores and applying them in 
Integration Server, see the "Securing Communications with the 
Server" section in the webMethods Integration Server 
Administrator Guide. Also see the relevant CloudStreams 
Provider document to find the connection's advanced property 
"Trust store Alias", for applying the trust store in the 
connection.
Note: You can also create trust stores using a publicly 
available tool, for example, Keytool or KeyStore Explorer.

Step 5: If the Integration Server version is 10.0, 
and if you are impacted by WST-3082, then
manually edit the manifest.v3 file located under the
WmCloudStreams package to include the following entry:

<value name="classloader">package</value>

Restart Integration Server.
