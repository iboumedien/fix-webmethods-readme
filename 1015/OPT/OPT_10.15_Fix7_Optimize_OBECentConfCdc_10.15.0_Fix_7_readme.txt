1.0 Fix Name

IBM webMethods BPM Optimize OBECentConfCdc 10.15.0 Fix 7


2.0 Fix ID

OPT_10.15_Fix7


3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects:

- Analytic Engine 10.15


4.0 Requirements and Dependencies


For Optimize environments, the fix version of the Optimize component fixes must
be the same as the fix version of Optimize shared components fixes
(wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedLib and wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedUI).


5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.


6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Attempting to apply the Optimize Fix to an installation where
 MWS is configured to use the embedded Derby database will fail.
 There will be an error reported in the IBM webMethods Update Manager
 log. For all other supported Relational Database Management Systems
 configured for MWS, the fix can be applied successfully.

 There is no workaround at this time.


 2. IBM does not recommend uninstalling this fix because 
 Optimize or other webMethods products might not work properly.

 To be able to restore your Optimize installation, before you install
 the fix you must back up the Optimize database and your file system.


7.0 Fix Contents


WMN-8733 (OPT_10.15_Fix7)
In the Process Instance page of Monitor, the Resubmit Closest button does not resubmit a process instance that was previously resubmitted and in which the failed step is contained in a sub-process.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8766 (OPT_10.15_Fix7)
In webMethods Monitor, the pub.monitor.archive services fail to archive a PostgresSQL database if the database name contains "db2".

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8767 (OPT_10.15_Fix7)
In the Process Instance page of Monitor, when you click Resubmit Closest or Resubmit Earliest, the process instance is not resubmitted and an error appears in the log. The issue occurs when the process model logging level is set to 2 - Errors only.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8748 (OPT_10.15_Fix7)
In the Advanced search tab of the Services page, when you apply a filter whose Value parameter is in scientific notation (for example "3E150"), an error occurs.
 
The issue is resolved.



OBE-13001 (OPT_10.15_Fix6)
In the Edit Role page of Optimize, granting access to a service fails with an error.

The issue is resolved.



OBE-12616 (OPT_10.15_Fix5)
In IBM webMethods Optimize, creating a table in Oracle Database 23 using Database Component Configurator fails.

The issue is resolved. Log in as table owner before you run the database migration script.

WMN-8720 (OPT_10.15_Fix5)
A security vulnerability in the Services page of Monitoring is now fixed.

The issue is resolved.

OBE-12985 (OPT_10.15_Fix5)

The issue is resolved.



WMN-8362 (OPT_10.15_Fix4)
In webMethods Monitor, several API queries consume a lot of memory.

The issue is resolved. The following services are modified so that the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter in monitor.cnf applies to them.

pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceList
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListWithFilter
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomDataSet
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomData
pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList

If you set useExactMatch to True, your search query will return only those INSTANCEID,
PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID results which exactly match your search term. An isExactMatch input parameter is also added to these services. isExactMatch works like the useExactMatch parameter, but takes priority over it.

New parameter reference:
  isExactMatch
  
  This parameter allows you to control whether your search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  
Valid values are:
  false - Default value for isExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  true - If you set isExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID. The query will return only those
  results which exactly match your search term.
