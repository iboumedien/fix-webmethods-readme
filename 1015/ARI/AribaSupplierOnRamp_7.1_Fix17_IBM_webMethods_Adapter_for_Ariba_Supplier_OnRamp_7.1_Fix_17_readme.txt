1-1YWEYS (ARIBASUPPLIERONRAMP_7.1_Fix3)
Missing required "text" attribute for Status element in the Response cXML when a 
request is not processed successfully.

After successfully processing a request, webMethods
Ariba Supplier OnRamp creates a "text" attribute for the Status element in the 
Response cXML. However, if the request is not successfully processed, 
the Response cXML created by the OnRamp does not contain the "text" attribute. 
This results in an invalid response because the "text" attribute is required for 
indicating the correct status of the transaction.

This issue is resolved by updating the
"wm.b2b.cxml.messages:createErrorResponse" service to populate an appropriate 
value for the "text" attribute based on the status code of the request process. 
Also, in the wm.ariba.supplier.tn.handlerUtils:checkSetupResultAndGetResponse
service, the value of the briefMessageKey parameter is now changed from "Order 
processing failure" to "PunchOut Setup Request processing failed". Ariba Supplier 
OnRamp now logs a correct error message in Trading Networks when a 
PunchoutSetupRequest is not processed successfully.
