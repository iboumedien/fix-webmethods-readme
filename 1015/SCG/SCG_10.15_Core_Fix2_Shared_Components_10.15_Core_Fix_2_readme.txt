5.0 Platform Support

webMethods Shared Component 10.15 Core Fix 2 is supported on the same platforms and operating
systems and with the same JREs as webMethods Integration Server 10.15.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

None.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

This fix addresses the following issues:

WSC-743 (WSC_10.15_Core_Fix2)
In some cases, the JUL bridge will try to retrieve the resource bundle for a message that 
is not logged because we are configered for a less verbose level. This can lead to unexpected performance 
degradation at less verbose logging levels.

WSC-735 (WSC_10.15_Core_Fix1)
When using some logging frameworks, the log messages do not contain exceptions.
