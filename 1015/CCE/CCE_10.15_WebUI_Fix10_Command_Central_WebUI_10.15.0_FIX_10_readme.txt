In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to

CCE-8385 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix5)
In the Command Central web user interface, when you navigate to Installations 
and attempt to sort the available installations by status, the Status column 
does not display the installations in the correct order.

The issue is resolved. 

CCE-8371 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix5)
In the Command Central web user interface, the Create Mirror Repository 
dialog box does not display the last letter of long repository names in 
the "Repositories to use as sources" and "Product repositories to filter by" fields.

The issue is resolved. 

CCE-8309 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix5)
When upgrading a stack using the Stacks view of the Command Central web user 
interface, the Credentials drop-down box provides the option to use a password-only 
alias. However, when using the password-only alias for upgrading a stack, 
the upgrade operation fails with an exception.

The issue is resolved. The password-only alias is no longer listed in the
Credentials drop-down box. 

CCE-8209 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix4)
In the Command Central web user interface, when you navigate to Installations > 
Environments, if the list of environments does not fit on the screen and you scroll 
down to select an environment from the bottom of the list, the scroll bar incorrectly 
goes back to the top.

The issue is resolved. Now the scroll bar stays at the correct position. 

CCE-8193 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix4)
In the Command Central web user interface, the Create Mirror Repository dialog 
box does not fully display long repository names in the "Repositories to use as 
sources" and "Product repositories to filter by" fields.

The issue is resolved. Now a scroll bar appears on the bottom of the fields if 
they contain repositories with long names. 


CCE-8095 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix4)
Software AG Command Central uses an outdated version of the 
third-party gwt-material-jquery component, which has known security vulnerabilities.

The issue is resolved. The gwt-material-jquery.jar file is migrated to the stable 
version 2.6.1.


CCE-7982 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix4)
When creating a layer configuration in the Stacks view of the Command Central 
web user interface, the Credentials Aliases drop-down box incorrectly lists 
username credentials entries for password-only credentials aliases.

The issue is resolved. Now the Credentials Aliases drop-down box lists only 
password entries for password-only credentials aliases. 


CCE-7944 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix4)
In the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface, when adding a 
new node with a new runtime and a new database layer, the tooltip and labels 
for the available properties for the database layer are incorrect. 
Furthermore, the dropdown list for selecting property values from
another layer is empty but the button for it appears enabled.

The issue is resolved. The toolttip and labels are now correct and the button 
for empty dropdown list is disabled. 

CCE-8125 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix3)
In the Add Installation wizard in the Command Central web user interface, when 
you add a new installation with a hostname value different than "localhost" and 
you select "Install Platform Manager", the "Summary" step states that Platform 
Manager is already installed, which is incorrect.

The issue is resolved. The "Summary" step now correctly states that Platform 
Manager will be installed. 


CCE-7964 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix2)
The Command Central web user interface stops responding when you navigate to 
CCE > Command Central Server in the local installation, select the Configuration

properties do not work properly and are not aligned.

The issue is now resolved.


CCE-7825 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix1)
When adding a new node or runtime or upgrading a stack, the list of credentials 
alias parameters is not sorted.

The issue is now resolved. 


CCE-7828 (CCE_10.15_WebUI_Fix1)
When upgrading a stack or creating a runtime or database layer in the stack, 
if you want to re-use the value of a property from other layers in the stack, 
the list of available properties is empty.

The issue is now resolved. 


8.0 Installation

Use IBM webMethods Command Central to install fixes on multiple machines from a central location (9.7 or later), 
or IBM webMethods Update Manager to install fixes on one machine at a time. For instructions,
see the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are running Command Central on a Windows operating system, and you uninstall Fix 6 or higher to downgrade to Fix 5 or higher, Command Central might fail to start. 
The issue occurs because the Tanuki Java Service Wrapper reverts from version 3.5.53 to version 3.5.50. 
Fix 5 or higher of Command Central reference should reference the newer version of the wrapper, while Fix 4 and lower should reference reference the older version.
Re-registering the Command Central Windows service ensures that Command Central references the correct version of the Tanuki wrapper.
To re-register the Command Central Windows service:
1.Open a command prompt, navigate to the [Software AG_directory]\profiles\CCE\bin directory and run the following command to remove the Command Central service:
service.bat -remove
3.Run the following command to register the Windows service for Command Central:
service.bat -install


Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.


Uninstall using IBM webMethods Command Central or IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, see 
the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.
