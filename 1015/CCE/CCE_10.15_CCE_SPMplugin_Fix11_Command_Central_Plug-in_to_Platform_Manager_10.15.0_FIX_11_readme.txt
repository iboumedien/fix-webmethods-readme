8.0 Installation

Use IBM webMethods Command Central to install fixes on multiple machines from a central location (9.7 or later), 
or IBM webMethods Update Manager to install fixes on one machine at a time. For instructions,
see the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are running Command Central on a Windows operating system, and you uninstall Fix 6 or higher to downgrade to Fix 5 or higher, Command Central might fail to start. 
The issue occurs because the Tanuki Java Service Wrapper reverts from version 3.5.53 to version 3.5.50. 
Fix 5 or higher of Command Central reference should reference the newer version of the wrapper, while Fix 4 and lower should reference reference the older version.
Re-registering the Command Central Windows service ensures that Command Central references the correct version of the Tanuki wrapper.
To re-register the Command Central Windows service:
1.Open a command prompt, navigate to the [Software AG_directory]\profiles\CCE\bin directory and run the following command to remove the Command Central service:
service.bat -remove
3.Run the following command to register the Windows service for Command Central:
service.bat -install


Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.


Uninstall using IBM webMethods Command Central or IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, see 
the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.
