7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

CCE-9359 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Command Central might take a long time to validate a composite template.

The issue is resolved. To improve performance, Command Central reduces the number
of SSH connection requests during the validation process.


CCE-9290 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix9)
Command Central might time out and fail to validate, apply, or create a layer definition if you use a
large template.

This issue is resolved.


CCE-9286 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix9)
When you update a configuration from the Command Central web user interface, Platform Manager
removes properties from the custom_wrapper.conf file that it incorrectly detects as duplicate.
The issue occurs when the custom_wrapper.conf file includes multiple properties with the same
Java option.

The issue is resolved. You can now configure Platform Manager to retain Java options,
such as "--add-opens", even if they appear multiple times in the configuration file. Use the new
"com.softwareag.platform.management.configuration.wrapper.allow.duplicates.for" Java system property
to specify a comma-separated list of options. Default is "--add-opens".


CCE-9111 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix9)
Opening a License key in Command Central that has empty Metering data might result in LicenseKeyNotFoundException.
The issue is resolved. License files are loaded and opened successfully.


CCE-9143 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix9)
When applying new fixes to an existing Command Central installation, the cc.properties file located 
at <UserDir>\.sag\cc.properties is overwritten by the default version of the file.

This issue is resolved. Installing fixes no longer overwrites existing cc.properties files.


CCE-9054 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix9)
Мigrating Command Central to version 10.15 fails if Command Central is configured to use an LDAP server and the configuration contains a path to a JKS truststore.

The issue is now resolved.


CCE-8461 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix6)
When you export an instance which contains a database component with a null 
tablespace, Command Central generates a template which excludes all database 
components which have valid tablespace names.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-8357 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix6)
Software AG Command Central uses version 2.9.2 of the Apache Mina SSHD library 
which has known security vulnerabilities.

The issue is resolved. Command Central now uses the stable version 2.10.0 of 
Apache Mina SSHD.


SPM-5609 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix5)
Software AG Command Central now uses version 3.5.53 of the Java Service Wrapper. 
Uninstalling this fix reverts the Tanuki wrapper version to 3.5.50.


CCE-8406 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix5)
In the Command Central web user interface, when you click Refresh on the Proxy 
Configuration page of an Integration Server instance, Command Central does not 
display proxy servers which you have recently created from the Integration Server 
Administrator interface.

The issue is resolved.


CCE-8353 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix5)
Software AG Command Central uses an outdated version of the
third party component Apache Xmlgraphics batik, which has known security vulnerabilities.

The issue is resolved. The Apache Xmlgraphics batik jar is migrated to the stable version 1.17. 


CCE-8308 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix5)
Attempting to add an infrastructure layer in a stack using an exported Platform Manager 
template fails with an error. The issue occurs because the "nodes" parameter is missing 
in the exported template.

The issue is resolved. The "nodes" parameter is now included in the exported Platform Manager 
template and you can use the template to add an infrastructure layer. 


CCE-8313 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Command Central might fail to connect to Platform Manager over an HTTPS connection. 
The issue occurs because of a defect in the JDK that Command Central uses.
The issue is resolved. Now Command Central is updated with the workaround 
described in the JDK-8160347 issue.


CCE-8292 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix4)
When bootstrapping Platform Manager on a remote machine that has an SSH server, 
the operation fails because the SSH connection timeout is exceeded.

The issue is resolved. The default SSH connection timeout value is now increased 
to 10 seconds. Furthermore, you can now configure custom timeout values for the 
SSH connection and the shell commands executed on the remote SSH machine 
(during the remote bootstrap) by setting the following Java system properties:

com.softwareag.platform.management.client.remoteaccess.ssh.connection.timeout.seconds
Configure for OSGI-CCE. The time interval in seconds, for which Command Central waits when
connecting to a remote SSH server before the job fails.
Default: 10

com.softwareag.platform.management.client.remoteaccess.shellcommand.timeout.seconds
Configure for OSGI-CCE. The time interval in seconds, for which Command Central waits when
executing shell commands while bootstrapping on a remote SSH server before the job fails.
Default: 60 


CCE-8257 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix4)
The contents of the installation report that can be generated through the 
Licensing > Reports tab on the Command Central web user interface are updated as 
follows: The report now includes the license key expiration date and status (valid, 
invalid, expired, or expiring within 30 days) for product instances that require a license.
The report no longer includes the maximum heap size because this information is not 
relevant to licensing.


CCE-8077 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Software AG Command Central uses an outdated version of the third party component 
Apache Batik, which has known security vulnerabilities. 

The issue is resolved. The Apache Batik jars are migrated to the stable version 1.16.0. 


CCE-8068 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Command Central uses the third party Apache Mina SSHD library, which has known security 
vulnerabilities.

CCE-8064 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Command Central uses an outdated version of the third party component Apache XmlGraphics 
Commons, which has known security vulnerabilities. 

The issue is resolved. The Apache XmlGraphics Commons jar is migrated to the stable 
version 2.8.0. 


CCE-8054 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix3)
The Command Central logs contain exception errors, related to failed requests 
for opening URLs. The issue occurs because Command Central provides incorrect 
URLs after refreshing configuration data.

The issue is resolved. Command Central logs no longer contain exception errors 
due to incorrect URLs. 


CCE-7830 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix3)
When you install Platform Manager on the local machine using the "sag-spm-boot-local" 
template either through the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface, 
or through the Command Central CLI, the installation is successful but a null pointer 
exception error is logged in the Command Central default.log.

The issue is resolved. 


CCE-7971 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Upgrading Command Central to version 10.15 fails if the source Command
Central has been modified to use the Entrust encryption.

The issue is resolved. You can now upgrade a source Command Central that 
uses the Entrust encryption to version 10.15. The required libraries for 
the Entrust encryption are now added to the migration framework in Command Central.


CCE-7805 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Running an installation with Command Central templates takes a long time in
large environments.

The issue occurs in large environments because the handle of runtimes status
for previous layers is done for every node from the previous layer.

The issue is resolved. The handle of runtimes status for previous layers is now
done only for nodes that are part of the current layer.


CCE-7558 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix2)
With Command Central, uninstalling fixes might fail when more than one
version of the same fix has been installed.

The issue occurs when the fixes that are being uninstalled are passed as artifact
names containing only Fix ID and Platform Manager is restarted during the operation.

The issue is resolved. The fix deprovision job now runs successfully.


CCE-7822 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix1)
In the Command Central web user interface, when creating a new layer in a stack and 
you switch to the credentials properties, the create layer operation fails. The new product 
instance with the selected properties is added in the Installations > Instances, but the 
corresponding layer is not created in the stack. 

Тhe issue is now resolved.


CCE-7829 (CCE_10.15_Core_Fix1)
With Command Central, bootstrapping a remote Platform Manager with invalid SSH 
connectivity credentials results in a misleading error message.

The issue is resolved. The error message now states that the authentication 
to the remote host is unsuccessful.


8.0 Installation

Use IBM webMethods Command Central to install fixes on multiple machines from a central location (9.7 or later), 
or IBM webMethods Update Manager to install fixes on one machine at a time. For instructions,
see the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are running Command Central on a Windows operating system, and you uninstall Fix 6 or higher to downgrade to Fix 5 or higher, Command Central might fail to start. 
The issue occurs because the Tanuki Java Service Wrapper reverts from version 3.5.53 to version 3.5.50. 
Fix 5 or higher of Command Central reference should reference the newer version of the wrapper, while Fix 4 and lower should reference reference the older version.
Re-registering the Command Central Windows service ensures that Command Central references the correct version of the Tanuki wrapper.
To re-register the Command Central Windows service:
1.Open a command prompt, navigate to the [Software AG_directory]\profiles\CCE\bin directory and run the following command to remove the Command Central service:
service.bat -remove
3.Run the following command to register the Windows service for Command Central:
service.bat -install

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.


Uninstall using IBM webMethods Command Central (9.7 or later) or IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, see 
the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.
