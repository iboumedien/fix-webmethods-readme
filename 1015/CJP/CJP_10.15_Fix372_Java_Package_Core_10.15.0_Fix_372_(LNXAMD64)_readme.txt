There are no further explicit fix requirements, but it is strongly 
recommended that you install all available product fixes at the same time as Common Java Package 10.15 Fix 372.

Fixes are cumulative. Therefore, for each of the listed fixes, you can install the specified fix or 
later.



5.0 Platform Support

This fix is supported on Windows, Linux, Mac, zLinux and AIX operating systems.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

*  Since Fix 354:
   During the installation of this fix, you may need to select and install a large number of dependent fixes. This is expected behavior. 
   Make sure you select the dependent fixes and proceed with the installation.

   After installing this fix, all previously installed webMethods products on the environment will start using Azul Java version 17.50 for runtime. 
   On AIX and zLinux, the products will start using IBM Semeru Java 17.0.9.

   Future fixes on webMethods 10.15 products will require and only work with Java 17 runtime.

*  Since Fix 152: 
-  Please do not install this Java fix while using webMethods Business Console (SBP) product, it is still facing issues with the 
   ZIP64 Extra Field Validation and looking forward for delivering a fix asap.
-  Improved ZIP64 Extra Field Validation (JDK-8302483 (not public))
   java.util.zip.ZipFile has been updated to provide additional validation of ZIP64 extra fields 
   when opening a ZIP file. This validation may be disabled by setting the system property 
   jdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation to true.

*  Since Fix 152: 
   Installing this fix on an environment that also includes UI Development Plug-in to Designer 10.15 Fix3:
   DES_10.15_CAD_Fix3 might cause project deployment to My webMethods Server to fail.
   To workaround this issue, install My webMethods Server on the machine that hosts the Composite Application Development installation,
   and then install fix  My webMethods Server 10.15 Fix 6: MWS_10.15_Fix6.

*  Since Fix 149: If you plan adding products to the existing installation folder, 
   please, don't deploy this fix.

*  Since release: All files in the "<installDir>/jvm/jvm" folder will be set to original vendor content.
   Manual changes in the "<installDir>/jvm/jvm" folder need to be redone after the fix install.
   The old files can be found for reference in the "<installDir>/jvm/jvmXXX.bck" folder.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.
