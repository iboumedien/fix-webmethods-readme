its value must not contain the path to the OpenSSL libraries as shipped for the IBM EntireX
product, for example "/opt/softwareag/common/security/openssl/lib", nor the system's standard
paths "/usr/lib64", "/usr/lib", "/lib64" and/or "/lib"!

8.0 Installation

Install using IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at 
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.

(Linux only) If not done already, either install all mentioned products below "/opt/softwareag" or
create a symbolic link at "/opt/softwareag" pointing to the actual installation directory.

(Linux only) Some products might still setup the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH and append
the system's standard paths "/usr/lib64", "/usr/lib", "/lib64" and/or "/lib". They usually do this
via a script ending on "env" and residing in the product's INSTALL/-directory, e.g.
/opt/softwareag/EntireX/INSTALL/exxenv_, etc. These lines have to be edited and the system's
standard paths need to be removed.
Example before editing:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${exxlibpath}:/lib64:/usr/lib64
Example after editing:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${exxlibpath}

*Please note*, these changes are only necessary on Linux systems when either the system's tools or
one of the mentioned products cannot be started and fail to resolve symbols from the OpenSSL
libraries. The changes should not be made on other systems!



9.0 Uninstallation

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.

Uninstall using IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at 
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.
