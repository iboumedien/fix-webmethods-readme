PIF-15875
Broker Java Admin API now supports reporting storage cache utilization. API
BrokerServerClient.getStorageStats() now contains the following additional fields:
- sessions[].max_cache_kbytes -- (long) Maximum storage cache size.
- sessions[].current_cache_kbytes_inuse -- (long) Current storage cache size in use.

PIF-16240
Sometimes the following error appears in the log:
javax.jms.JMSException: [BRM.10.4001] JMS: No response from Broker.

This issue occurs when the connection loss is not properly detected by the caller.

This issue is resolved. Now, a proper exception appears when a connection loss is detected.

PIF-15913 (BR_10.15_Java_API_Fix6)
Broker 10.15 now supports JRE 17 at runtime and continues to support JRE 11. The bytecode for
client libraries is generated for Java 11.

PIF-15804 (BR_10.15_Java_API_Fix4)
Uninstallation fails for wMFix.Broker.SharedBundles fix with the following error:
Missing requirement: JMS Client API requires 'java.package; iaik.security.jsse.provider 0.0.0' but
it could not be found.

This issue occurs due to incorrect fix dependencies. A second attempt uninstalls the fix correctly.

This issue has been resolved.

PIF-15716 (BR_10.15_Java_API_Fix3)
Broker JMS API method WmJMSConfig.setKeepAliveAttempts() now sets the keep-alive attempts
correctly.

PIF-15765 (BR_10.15_Java_API_Fix3)
webMethods Broker command-line tools work but report the error message
"Self-Integrity Check FAILED".

This issue occurs because the Broker/lib/enttoolkit.jar file was not getting updated by the earlier
Java API fixes.

This issue is resolved.

PIF-15653 (BR_10.15_Java_API_Fix2)
Broker JMS API now uses in-built methods to encrypt passwords. Entrust library is no longer used.

PIF-15672 (BR_10.15_Java_API_Fix2)
webMethods Broker JMS Client throws following exception while processing very large messages:
java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException
at com.webmethods.jms.protocol.ProtocolHandler.read
at com.webmethods.jms.protocol.BinaryProtocolHandler.dispatch
at com.webmethods.jms.protocol.ProtocolHandler$LinkReader.run
at java.lang.Thread.run

This issue occurs because of an integer overflow error while attempting to increase the buffer size
from 1 GB to 2 GB.

This issue has been resolved. Now, Broker JMS Client should be able to process very large messages
up to 2 GB in size.

PIF-15564 (BR_10.15_Java_API_Fix1)
The Broker Java and JMS APIs now use Entrust Toolkit version 8.1.20.

With the latest Java fixes, the old Entrust Toolkit 8.0.33 cannot be used as it is signed with the
SHA1 algorithm.
With this update of Entrust Toolkit version to 8.1.20, Entrust as the SSL provider does not work
with Broker Java and JMS APIs, and Broker command-line tools.
