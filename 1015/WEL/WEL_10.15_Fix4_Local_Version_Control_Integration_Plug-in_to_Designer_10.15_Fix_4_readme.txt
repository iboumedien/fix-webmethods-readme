Designer provides an option to enable local service development in containerized
Integration Server or Microservices Runtime.

Enabling containerized local service development lets you mount a file volume 
into the Docker container through Designer and use version control in the 
Package Navigator.

To use Integration Server or Microservices Runtime inside a Docker container as 
local development server, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- Docker and Designer reside on the same host.
- Create or pull docker images from the Docker registry. The Microservices 
  Runtime image is available in Container Registry 
  https://containers.softwareag.com/. Ensure that the MSR image from the 
  registry has the functionality you need.
- Mount the corresponding host directory of local Git repository.
  Following is a sample for the startup command:
  docker run -i -t -d --name $[container_name] \
  -v $[container_named_volume]:[Install_Dir]/IntegrationServer/packages \
  -v [host_git_project_location]:/[container_git_project_location]
  -p [host_primary_port:]primary_port [image_name] /bin/bash
  
You also have the option to configure multiple git repositories as:
  -v [host_git_project_location1]:/[container_git_project_location1]
  -v [host_git_project_location2]:/[container_git_project_location2]

For example, in terminal, enter the following command:
docker run --name <name> -p 5558:5555 -d 
  -v C:/Users/foo/git/repo1:/opt/git/repo1 \
  -v C:/Users/foo/git/repo2:/opt/git/repo2 \
  -v <volume name>:/opt/softwareag/IntegrationServer/packages \
  sagcr.azurecr.io/webmethods-microservicesruntime:10.15
 
In Designer, you should add C:/Users/foo/git/repo1 Container Path:/opt/git/repo1
and C:/Users/foo/git/repo2 Container Path:/opt/git/repo2 in Host Path.

Alternatively, you can use individual repositories as one volume by mounting the
parent folder.

For example,
docker run --name <name> -p 5558:5555 -d -v C:/Users/foo/git:/opt/git -v <volume
 name>:/opt/softwareag/IntegrationServer/packages \
 sagcr.azurecr.io/webmethods-microservicesruntime:10.15

In Designer, to mount a file volume in Local Service Development, perform the 
following:
1. In Designer, select Window > Preferences > Software AG > Service Development 
   > Local Service Development, select Enable local service development in 
   containerized Integration Server or Microservices Runtime.
2. To set the docker volume and port details, click Add. The Add New Volume 
   dialog box appears.
3. Enter Host Path, Container Path, and click OK.
4. Enter the port number in Port.
5. Click Apply.

After configuring the volume, update the port for the connected server. Then, 
set up local service development by creating a new project or importing a 
project into your local workspace.


WEL-162 (WEL_10.15_Fix2)
The local service development feature does not work on
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).

The local service development feature does not work on VDI when
the repository and workspace are in a network path.

This issue is now resolved by providing an option to enable VDI support.
To use the local service development feature, start Designer as an Administrator
user and select the "Enable local service development on virtual desktop 
infrastructure (Administrator user only)" check box. 


WEL-156 (WEL_10.15_Fix1)
Designer does not identify a project as a local service development project
if the project is under a shortcut or the soft link for a folder cloned from Git.

The issue is now resolved.
