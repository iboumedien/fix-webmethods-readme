This fix addresses the following issues:

TUX-60
Updated copyright notes, vendor and product names for IBM rebranding.

1-1A4CBD (Tuxedo_6.0_Fix1)
When creating a Tuxedo Adapter Synchronous service, the 
list of available Tuxedo services is not displayed in 
sorted order.

In webMethods Developer, when creating a Synchronous 
adapter service, the list of available Tuxedo services 
in the Select Tuxedo Service drop-down list box is not 
sorted. This makes searching for a particular service 
difficult.

This issue is now resolved. The Tuxedo services listed 
are now sorted alphabetically by name.


1-1A4CD0 (Tuxedo_6.0_Fix1)
During runtime of a Synchronous adapter service, the 
Tuxedo Adapter does not allow display of output 
parameters in response to an Application Exception 
from the Jolt Server.

When running a Synchronous adapter service, the Tuxedo 
Adapter throws an AdapterException to report an error 
when the adapter receives an Application Exception from 
the Jolt Server. However, the AdapterException does not 
provide a way to access the output parameters from the 
Application Exception. The Tuxedo Jolt APIs provide an 
exception handling pattern where, when throwing an 
application exception (for example, InsufficientBalance 
in an accounting application), the client can get a handle 
to a Java object containing certain output parameters 
resulting from a Tuxedo Service invocation. Because 
Tuxedo allows output parameters to be retrieved from an 
object embedded in an application exception, the Tuxedo 
Adapter should provide the same functionality.

This issue is resolved. The user can now select a new 
parameter, "Throw Application Level Exception", when 
creating a Synchronous adapter service to indicate how 
the adapter is to handle an Application Exception 
received from the Jolt Server.

- Select the "Throw Application Level Exception" 
parameter to specify that the Synchronous service 
execution returns a status of -1, and also returns the 
output parameters resulting from the remote Tuxedo 
service execution. The adapter does not throw an 
AdapterException.

- Clear the "Throw Application Level Exception" parameter 
to specify that the Tuxedo Adapter throws an 
AdapterException. This is the default behavior.
