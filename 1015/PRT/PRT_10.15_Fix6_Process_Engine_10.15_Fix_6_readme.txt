WPE-5424 
Process Engine does not invoke pub.prt.callback:CallbackService when the EventType parameter is ProcessStepInstanceError.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-5208 (PRT_10.15_Fix5)
In webMethods Process Engine, wm.prt.status:BroadcastTrigger trigger gets enabled with Integration server restart.

The issue is now resolved. A new property, watt.prt.enableBroadcastTrigger can be added in prt.cnf config file. Set the property to false before restarting
Integration Server so that Process Engine does not enable the trigger during package loading.
If the property is not defined or set to true, Process Engine enables the broadcast trigger.

New Property Reference:
watt.prt.enableBroadcastTrigger
Used to configure whether the broadcast trigger is enabled.
Valid values are:
- True (default) - Process Engine enables the broadcast trigger during package loading.
- False - Process Engine does not enable the broadcast trigger during package loading.

WPE-5294 (PRT_10.15_Fix4)
If you configure watt.server.http.X-Content-Type-Options= to "nosniff", the Settings page of the WmPRT package does not function properly.
 
The issue is resolved.

The issue is resolved

WPE-5155 (PRT_10.15_Fix2)
In webMethods Process Engine, support for callback services is now added.

You can create and configure a custom callback service using the pub.prt.callback folder, which contains the specification of the callback service and the structure of the callback events.

Please add the following in prt.cnf file in WmPRT folder.
watt.prt.processCallbackService=<callback service>

pub.prt.callback:CallbackService - The specification of the callback service. It has the following input parameters:
EventType - One of the following types ProcessInstanceChange, ProcessInstanceError, ProcessInstanceLogMessage, ProcessInstanceLogCustomId, ProcessStepInstanceChange, ProcessStepInstanceError, ProcessStepLoopInstanceChange, and ProcessStepInstanceTransition.

AuditTimestamp - Timestamp when the audit was generated.

EventData - Corresponds to the EventType structure.

Process Engine will invoke your custom callback service during the execution of process instances.

WPE-5199 (PRT_10.15_Fix2)
Incorrect hours in the Audit timestamp in Process Engine callback services.

The Audit timestamp in the callback service was returning hours in
"0-11" format, without AM/PM indication. The callback services have
been modified to return hours in "0-23" format.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-5151 (PRT_10.15_Fix1)
The inline subprocess instances that are interrupted when the parent instance reaches terminal status, are not cleaned by Storage Cleaner.
