7.0 Fix Contents 

WST-9081 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

Users encountered a 403 Forbidden error while enabling a Jira 
basic connection. The error occurred because the system was 
sending an HTTP GET request with an empty body but with an 
XML header.

The issue is now resolved by updating the logic to attach 
the XML header only when a payload exists.

WST-8811 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

When creating a REST connector, the "Content-Type" and "Accept" headers 
are derived from the list of Request & Response media types found in the 
Swagger V2 or OpenAPI V3 files as follows:

- If "application/json" is found in the list, it is selected by default.

- If "application/json" is not present, the first available media type 
in the list is selected.

- If the first media type is "/", the next available type (if present) 
is selected.

- If only "/" is found in the list, the default is set to "application/octet-stream".

- The value of the response's Content-Type header is set to match the request's 
Accept header.

WST-8761 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

Previously, when creating a REST connector using a Swagger V2.0 file, 
parameters of type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" were being skipped. 

This issue is now resolved.

WST-8829 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

While creating a REST connector by importing a Swagger file, the "Accept" 
header was not being mapped correctly. Additionally, neither the "Content-Type" 
nor the "Accept" header was being mapped when importing an OpenAPI V3 file.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-8766 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

Previously, when creating a REST connector using a Swagger V2.0 file, 
no resources were generated if the file did not contain "definitions". 
This issue is now resolved. In such cases, an empty document will be 
created along with the resources.

WST-8779 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

Previously, when creating a REST connector using an OpenAPI file, 
the request JSON body for a resource was not generated correctly. 
This issue is now resolved.

WST-8735 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

When a Salesforce listener encountered the "Buffering capacity XXXX exceeded" 
error during runtime, it would repeatedly re-subscribe to the backend, 
eventually exhausting the daily event transaction limit in Salesforce.

This issue is now resolved. If the error occurs again, the listener will 
be suspended automatically.

WST-8993 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

The following issues were encountered when adding the Start Sequence action:

The ListDependents service did not return the correct results when populating 
data for each dependent. A Null Pointer Exception (NPE) occurred due to an 
unnecessary declaration of the ModelReaderWriter object in a child class, 
even though it was already declared and initialized in the parent class.

Both issues have now been resolved.

WST-9052 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

Upgraded jar versions for Vulnerable 3rd party component Jetty used to 11.0.20

WST-8596 (WST_10.15_Fix7)

Previously, the "Subject" field in JWT-based connections was always 
required, regardless of the connector metadata. This forced users 
to provide unnecessary input, even when the backend system considered 
the subject claim optional or not required.

To address this, the "Subject" claim is now configurable based on 
backend requirements. By default, CloudStreams treats the "Subject" 
field as optional. Connector developers can explicitly configure 
it as required within the connector definition.

WST-8675 (WST_10.15_Fix6)

Session tokens in webMethods Integration are automatically 
refreshed during service execution for all CloudStreams-based 
accounts when the session is detected as expired, based on 
the session timeout configuration. However, the refresh call 
does not respect the response timeout defined in the account 
configuration. Consequently, if the token refresh request is 
delayed or stuck, the main service execution thread is also 
blocked, leading to a hang.
 
This issue is now resolved.

WST-8679 (WST_10.15_Fix6)

Eclipse Jetty versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15 contained a 
security vulnerability that could lead to various risks. 
These vulnerabilities were addressed starting with Jetty 
version 11.0.16. CloudStreamsAnalytics previously included 
some of these affected Jetty jars, which have now been 
upgraded to version 11.0.17 to ensure security.

The issue is now resolved.

WST-8637 (WST_10.15_Fix6)

If the input data for a CloudStreams service execution is 
very large, enabling trace-level logging may result in an 
"Out of Memory" error. This issue is now resolved.

To avoid potential issues, it is recommended to refrain 
from enabling trace logging when working with large input 
data.

WST-8621 (WST_10.15_Fix6)


CloudStreams parsing of YAML file failed for error case with 
empty contents.

This issue is fixed with empty contents by handling empty 
contents in request, response & parameters handlers while 
parsing YAML 3.0 schema file.	

WST-8274 (WST_10.15_Fix5)

The service "wm.c10s.api.metadata_.services:SOAPinteractionById" 
was added without an implementation, which resulted in the 
error message: "Initialization of Java Service wm.c10s.api.
metadata_.services:SOAPinteractionById" being logged in the server.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-8329 (WST_10.15_Fix5)

When the Salesforce listener encounters client-side issues, 
it continuously tries to re-establish its connection with 
the backend. Occasionally, these issues persist, leading 
the listener to repeatedly attempt reconnection. During 
such times, the listener remains active but is unable to 
receive events from the backend.

This issue is now resolved. The listener will now attempt 
to reconnect up to five times. If these attempts fail, the 
listener will enter a suspended state, and a callback service 
will be triggered. Users can configure the callback service 
to receive notifications if the listener goes down.

WST-8204 (WST_10.15_Fix5)

When using Basic Authentication with a username and password, 
the correct user credentials are initially securely saved in 
the backend upon creating the connection. However, an issue 
was observed during subsequent edits to the connection properties. 
Specifically, if only the "username" field was modified without 
changing the password and the connection was saved again, the 
"password" field in the backend would unexpectedly update with 
masked characters (*****), which were placeholders designed to 
hide the original value.

This behavior was due to an additional feature that attempted 
to unmask the password field whenever the username field was changed.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-8213 (WST_10.15_Fix4)

Users encountered a SignatureDoesNotMatch error in the Amazon S3 
connector when the "x-amz-copy-source" header contained special 
characters used in operations such as "put object copy" and 
"upload part copy".

This issue is now resolved.

WST-8244 (WST_10.15_Fix4)

Users encountered an issue where the port number was removed 
from the request header "host" in AWS connectors.

This issue is now resolved.

This is resolved now.

WST-8088 (WST_10.15_Fix4)

While a listener is running, if there are runtime issues on the 
client-side and the listener recovery fails, the configured error 
callback service is not invoked.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-7587 (WST_10.15_Fix3)

In salesforce connector, a service is used to update the salesforce 
connection url during start-up sequence.
Invoking this service was failing due to some class serialization issue.

This issue is resolved now.

WST-7625 (WST_10.15_Fix3)

For a connector that normally expects and process backend response 
in json, can sometime receive a response in any other format other
than json causing a parsing error to happen. This error is directly
shown to the end user. As the error is directly shown to the end 
user it reveals implementation details that should never be 
revealed as it can open up security issues.

This issue is resolved now.

WST-7839 (WST_10.15_Fix3)

If special characters are used in the parameters while using the 
Amazon S3 connector resource, the backend fails to authenticate 
and sends a SignatureDoesNotMatch exception.

Note: Although this fix addresses the double slash formation issue 
arising from the Server URL and Resource URI, we may still encounter
a double slash ("//") at the beginning of the resource if the user 
provides input starting with a forward slash (“/”) and there is a 
placeholder forward slash in the Resource URI path.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-6935 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

In CloudStreams, we have provision to store event data in a mysql 
database table CLS_LISTENER_EVENT_STATE_DETAILS. One of its primary 
keys 'event_id' was having a size of VARCHAR (50) characters length. 
This size was not enough as it cannot store events data with event 
id being more of this length. So, we increased this to VARCHAR (256).

This issue is resolved now.

WST-7343 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

Updated warning message for no chunking during 
large file upload operations.

Failed to perform chunking on the request payload 
because the chunking option is disabled [pr.useChunking={0}] 
for connection ''{1}''. 

Heap space errors may appear while sending the large 
binary stream to the backend which does not support
HTTP chunking, even if large data handling is enabled in 
CloudStreams. 

If you want to send a large binary stream to the backend which 
supports HTTP chunking, it is recommended to set the 
Transport Protocol group field 'Use Chunking' to true 
on the Connection Configuration page.

WST-6953 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

During enable, if Salesforce returns error that we have sent invalid 
replayID, we confirm whether the error needs to be corrected or not. 
If it needs to be corrected, then we switch replay option to ALL and 
continue. If it doesn't need to be corrected, then we ignore and 
return error to user.

WST-7295 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

When the Integration Server is shut down, the running listeners 
are not unsubscribed from the back end, which can sometimes result 
in the logs showing "Pool state error":
2023-05-22 15:51:42 IST [CLS.0504.9999W] (tid=1968) Pool state error 
in SF_Enterprise:SF_Enterprise_ConnA. Cannot process request., error 
code: 118 javax.resource.ResourceException: Pool state error in 
SF_Enterprise:SF_Enterprise_ConnA. Cannot process request., error 
code: 118
The back end ends the session due to inactivity.
This issue is resolved.

WST-7233 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

During Integration Server startup, a few listener event-based flow 
executions were failing with the following error: No deployed Axis 
service for this name.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-7033 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

Issue with deploying CloudStreams listener assets in an enabled 
state.
The problem occurred because CloudStreams attempted to deploy and 
enable the listener in the target environment before the connection 
was enabled. This issue is now resolved.

WST-6807 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

When a non-recoverable error occurs, the following status message 
is passed to callbackService: "disabling of listener initiated".
Ideally, disabling of a listener doesn't happen programmatically.

This issue is resolved. The error message has been modified to 
indicate the Suspended status of the listener, ensuring an improved 
error handling mechanism.

WST-7538 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

Integration Server swamped with a large volume of the following 
CloudStreams error: CLS.0050.0404W

This issue was observed due to the missing content-type header in 
the response. In a few scenarios where there is no response body, 
certain responses may not include a content-type header. The logger 
level was set to "WARNING" for the response content-type header check.

This issue is resolved. The logger level has been changed to DEBUG.

WST-7228 (WST_10.15_Fix2)

During failover, duplicate processing failed due to multiple package
reloads in WMIO. The inflight transactions during the package 
reloads are now tracked to filter for duplicates, thereby avoiding 
duplicate processing.

WST-7128 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

The Coupa connector is now enabled with multi-authentication, allowing 
users to connect to the service with different authentication mechanisms. 
However, the service execution was failing when users provided a different 
connection alias at runtime that was created with a different authentication 
mechanism.

This issue is now resolved. 

WST-6607 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Configuring empty callback service for listeners.

Errors were observed if you configured an empty callback 
service for listeners.

This issue is resolved. You can now configure an empty 
callback service for a listener.

WST-6609 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

The list API, which allows you to list a specific listener 
along with its alias by passing the 'searchListenerAlias' 
parameter, is not working as expected.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-6669 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

In the logs, Integration Server errors were observed while 
building assets using Asset Build Environment (ABE), indicating 
an issue with the Build process. However, the errors were 
observed due to parsing exception on an empty file.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-6770 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

If the password or access token of the Salesforce connector 
account associated with a disabled listener has expired, 
and users try to enable the listener, the following error 
message is displayed: "Assertion error during connection 
request from pool <ConnectionPool>, error code: 105".

The actual cause of the error is unclearly specified in 
the error message.

The issue is resolved. This fix ensures an improved error 
handling mechanism.

WST-6794 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

If the persistence of events is unsuccessful, the processing 
of events was prevented.

As a fix to this issue, we introduced a configuration that expected 
users to manually set the "wst.listener.persist.onError.process" 
property in "wst-config.properties" to "true".

This fix reverts the previous changes.

WST-6801 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

The consumer secret value from the OAuth token generation modal 
was not automatically populated along with other fields in the 
Connection page.

This issue is resolved. CloudStreams now automatically copies 
the consumer secret value to the Connection page after successful 
OAuth token generation.

WST-6806 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

On the Connections page, if users enable or disable a 
connection and then try to reload the screen using the 
“Refresh” icon located at the top-right corner of the 
table, the enable or disable call is triggered again. 

Due to this, users observed unnecessary warning messages 
in the user interface. 

This issue is now resolved.

WST-6831 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

If the password or access token of the Salesforce connector 
account associated with a disabled listener has expired and 
the custom package is reloaded, and users try to enable the 
listener, the following error message is displayed: "Unable 
to initialize the connection factory associated with alias 
'<Connection_Alias>'., error code: Connection configuration 
alias '<Connection_Alias>' already registered. Original config 
was replaced with alias '<Connection_Alias>'".

The actual cause of the error is unclearly specified in the 
error message.

The issue is resolved. This fix ensures an improved error 
handling mechanism.

WST-6963 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

In the Connection Configuration section of the Administration 
> General page, when users select and save the "Lazy Asset Loading" 
option and then subsequently select and save the "Connection factory 
wire logging" option, it is observed that the "Connection factory wire 
logging" option gets saved successfully but the previously selected 
"Lazy Asset Loading" option gets deselected.  

This issue was observed because the default value for the "Lazy asset 
loading" checkbox was not set as a Boolean value, causing the user 
interface to send incorrect values to the server. 

The issue is resolved. Users should now be able to select and save 
both options without any conflicts.

WST-6485 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

In the "Microsoft Azure Storage" connector - "putBlob" operation, 
configuring the blob name with special characters slash ('/') is 
not allowed.

Apache HttpClient has released a breaking change in RequestConfig 
class (HTTPCLIENT-1968) from version 4.5.8 onwards to support URI 
normalization enabled by default. This change ensures splitting 
of path component into path segments when digesting a URI. And during
this process, it eliminates multiple leading slashes in the URI.

This issue is resolved. We have now preserved the old behavior by 
disabling the Normalize URI option.

WST-6966 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

After enabling a listener, the "Configure Listener" window that 
allows users to specify the Replay ID fails to appear for all 
the connectors other than Salesforce CRM SOAP. 

This issue is resolved.

WST-6982 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Updated warning message for no chunking during 
large file upload operations.

Failed to perform chunking on the request payload 
because the chunking option is disabled [pr.useChunking={0}] 
for connection ''{1}''. 

Heap space errors may appear while sending the large 
binary stream to the backend which does not support
HTTP chunking, even if large data handling is enabled in 
CloudStreams. 

If you want to send a large binary stream to the backend which 
supports HTTP chunking, it is recommended to set the 
Transport Protocol group field 'Use Chunking' to true 
on the Connection Configuration page.

WST-6437 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

CloudStreams does not support multiple comma-separated values 
for the "Accept" header.

CloudStreams does not parse the response correctly when multiple 
comma-separated values are specified for the "Accept" header with 
the request. This issue is observed because CloudStreams currently 
uses the "Accept" value to parse the response when the Accept header 
is specified with the request.

This issue is resolved. CloudStreams now uses the response 
Content-Type header value to parse the response for a given 
request.

WST-6992 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Users fail to deploy connector services if there occurs a mismatch 
in any internal parameter type (REST, SOAP) of a resource/operation 
and encounter the following error:"The existing parameter <parameterName> 
type mismatch, Source SOAP, Target REST".  

This issue is resolved.

Note: Before deploying a listener, ensure you disable the listener. 
By following this approach, you can safely deploy the listener in 
the target environment without losing events and messages. 

WST-7022 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

For a few URLs, when the Integration Server property 
“watt.net.ssl.client.hostnameverification” is set to “true”, 
CloudStreams throws a hostname verification error.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-6234 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

When users try to create a connection for Salesforce Marketing Cloud 
on Integration Server version 10.5 and CloudStreams, the following 
error message is displayed:"Missing required fields - Authorization 
Server URL. Authentication Server URL."

This issue is observed because of a change that was implemented as 
a part of WST-5261 fix.The Authorization Server URL and Authentication 
Server URL fields were shown with generic endpoint values in OAuthAccess 
Token generation modal window.

The Authentication Server URL and Authorization Server URL are required 
fields. The OAuthAccess Token generation modal window fetches default 
values configured in the connection group for a connector. However, 
a few connectors failed to declare the URL values in the connection group,
due to which, the input values for the Authentication Server URL and 
Authorization URL Server fields were left empty.

This issue is resolved. We now skip the validation for Authorization 
Server URL and Authentication Server URL fields. The Generate Access 
Token modal handles validation to the fields during the access token 
generation.

WST-6483 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

While using a connector, when users try to enable 'Publish performance 
metrics to database',the following error message is displayed: "Error 
while running com.softwareag.pg.pgmen.processors.PerformanceDataDeployer task.
Cause: java.lang.NullPointerException null java.lang.NullPointerException: null."

This issue is not observed in the Standalone Integration Server setup 
but is reproducible in the Clustered Integration Server setup while 
enabling 'Publish performance metrics to database' with the 
WmMicrosoftAzureStorageProvider package installed in the environment.

This issue is resolved.

WST-6608 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

If a listener encounters an error, CloudStreams error handler tries 
recovering the listener by making a total of 5 retry attempts without 
waiting between attempts.

This issue is resolved. We have now implemented the increasing backoff 
technique, which means that the error handler will try recovering the 
listener with an increasing wait time after every consecutive retry attempt.

WST-6725 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Even if the listener is disabled, the list API shows the runtime 
state as ACTIVE.

This issue is resolved. Now the list API shows the runtime state 
as DISABLED if the listener is disabled.

WST-6897 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

The value of the 'cause' field in the Listener error callback service 
payload is displayed as 'null' sometimes.

This issue occurs when no value is specified in the 'cause' field.

This issue is resolved. Now, if no value is specified in the 'cause' 
field, the field will not appear in the callback service payload.

WST-6937 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Salesforce CometD-based listeners fail to get disabled or unsubscribed 
intermittently. Due to this issue, a dangling listener gets created, 
which keeps listening to events even when the listener was disabled. 
And when the listener was enabled again, there were two listeners 
listening to events, resulting in duplicate events from the backend.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-6287 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

CloudStreams fails to add the Content-Type Header for BatchUpsert requests

The issue was observed because CloudStreams skipped the custom headers 
added by OData connector service handlers to avoid overriding user 
inputs from the service node default value.

This issue is resolved. CloudStreams now overrides default values 
appropriately.

WST-6711 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

An error occurred during OAuth token refresh when proxy is enabled 
to route requests in webMethods Integration Server.

This issue was observed because of the deprecation of the HttpClient 
library since v4.3.

This issue is resolved. The implementation of the deprecated getParams() 
method in HttpClient is now removed and it throws "Unsupported Operation" 
exception from the v4.5.5 release onwards. Due to this exception, the OAuth 
token refresh gets blocked, causing the access token to expire and the 
connection to break.

WST-6720 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Incorrect HTTP request methods were sent during the handling of a 
301 redirection response code.

For instance, when a provider responds to a PATCH request with 
a 301 redirect and a new location URL, the redirected request 
should honor the original HTTP method (i.e., PATCH) to perform 
the intended action.

This issue is now resolved with the introduction of a new key 
named "wst.allow.301.redirect". By default, this key is set to 
"true", which means that CloudStreams will honor the original 
request. To revert to the old behavior, the user needs to set 
this key to "false" and restart the Integration Server

WST-6916 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Existing and newly created Amazon S3 services fail to work correctly.  

The default value "https://s3.amazonaws.com/" for AWS S3 connection has 
a forward slash (“/”) placed at the end of the Server URL. During service 
execution, an additional forward slash (“/”) gets appended from the resource 
URI, which creates an invalid URI, something like this - "https://s3.amazonaws.com//". 

Due to this, service execution fails with an invalid signature. This issue 
may also cause service failure with null error for resources with only forward 
slash (“/”) in the path. 

This issue is resolved. We now normalize URI and replace multiple consecutive 
slashes in the Server URL with a single slash. 

WST-6943 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

During the validation process to confirm the presence of the correct 
schema and table in a database, some users with large amounts of data 
in their tables encountered memory issues. 

This issue is now resolved.

WST-6829 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Unable to generate an access token for the Jira provider from OAuth 2.0 
Authorization Code Flow dialog.This issue is observed because of a recent 
change implemented in the Jira API. The 'scope' and 'audience' parameters 
are required input fields in the authorization step. The Jira connector 
also requires an update to work seamlessly.

This issue is resolved. It is recommended that you use the Jira connector 
10.5 version build greater than #0033 or 10.7 version build greater than #0003.

WST-6591 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

In the error log, users were confused to observe the following error message: 
OAuth token aliases file [/opt/softwareag/IntegrationServer/instances/default
/packages/WmCloudStreams/config/auth/cls-oauthDetails.xml] could not be found! 
Could not load alias information into CloudStreams.

The cls-oauthDetails.xml file is generated only if OAuth tokens are defined 
in a global way and this kind of OAuth token definition is currently not 
used by any OOB connectors.

This issue is resolved. The error related to cls-oauthDetails.xml is now 
removed from the error log and added to the Debug log.

WST-6149 (WST_10.15_Fix1)

Changes made to parameters for resources in a REST connector fail to reflect 
in the "diffView" screen.

This issue is now resolved.

8.0 Installation

Step 1: Install using the IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions,
see the documentation at https://docs.webmethods.io.

Note: If you have migrated your connector services from a version
prior to CloudStreams 9.7 and impacted by WST-2213, and you are
yet to run the migration utility as suggested in WST-2213, go to
Step 2, else skip Step 2. If you have created your connector 
services with a CloudStreams 9.7 or later version, you do not 
need to run the migration utility

Step 2: Run the CloudStreams migration utility
(pub.cloudstreams.migration:migrate) to migrate your old
CloudStreams artifacts to the latest version.
For more information on the migration utility, see the 
Integration Server upgrade section in the "Upgrading Software 
AG Products" guide.

Step 3: In Integration Server, under Settings > Extended > 
Extended Settings, add "watt.net.ssl.client.useJSSE=true" to 
use the latest TLS versions.
Note: Restart Integration Server after applying the above 
property. In most cases, only this property is required for 
SaaS providers like Salesforce.
In some cases, where you want to force usage of any other 
protocols, for example, SSLv3 or a particular version of TLS 
properties, use the following properties:
 - watt.net.jsse.client.enabledProtocols
 - watt.net.ssl.client.handshake.minVersion
See the webMethods Integration Server Administrator Guide 
for the desired values of these properties.

Step 4: For a few SaaS back ends, the underlying JVM trust store 
may have the required certificates and you may not need to 
follow this step. But for back ends which have certificates 
that are not part of the JVM trust store, create and apply a 
new trust store in Integration Server with the certificates 
of the SaaS back end. This is a standard practice 
for setting up secure exchange of certificates. If the trust 
store is not present, in such cases, certificate related 
errors will appear.
To set up secure exchange of certificates, create a JKS trust 
store with the certificates of the SaaS back end. The trust 
store should contain all the certificates present in the 
certificate chain. Apply the trust store in the Integration 
Server administration page at the "Security > Keystore" 
section and use that trust store alias in your CloudStreams 
connection in the "Trust Store" field.
To know more about creating trust stores and applying them in 
Integration Server, see the "Securing Communications with the 
Server" section in the webMethods Integration Server 
Administrator Guide. Also see the relevant CloudStreams 
Provider document to find the connection's advanced property 
"Trust store Alias", for applying the trust store in the 
connection.
Note: You can also create trust stores using a publicly 
available tool, for example, Keytool or KeyStore Explorer.

Step 5: If the Integration Server version is 10.0, 
and if you are impacted by WST-3082, then
manually edit the manifest.v3 file located under the
WmCloudStreams package to include the following entry:

<value name="classloader">package</value>

Restart Integration Server.

Step 6: If the Integration Server version is 10.15,
and if you are impacted by WST-6720, then manually 
edit the wst-config.properties file located under the
<SAG-Installation-directory>\IntegrationServer\instances
\default\packages\WmCloudStreams\config\resources to include 
the following entry: wst.allow.301.redirect=true

Restart Integration Server.
