Error connection pool shut down on Microgateway pods.

Due to server internal error (for example, OutOfMemory) it might happen that the
'connection pool shutdown' message displays over and over again. After this
incident, there is an attempt to re-establish the internal connection pool that
further requests have a chance to go through. However, when the server errors

provided.

This issue is resolved.
