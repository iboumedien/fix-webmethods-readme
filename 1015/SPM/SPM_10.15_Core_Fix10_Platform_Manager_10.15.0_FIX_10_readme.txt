In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to

SPM-5664 (SPM_10.15_Core_Fix7)
In the Software AG Installer wizard, even if you clear the "Plan to use Command Central" checkbox,
the Platform Manager service is registered at the end of the installation process.

This issue is resolved. The Platform Manager service is registered only if you select the
"Plan to use Command Central" checkbox.


CCE-8477 (SPM_10.15_Core_Fix6)
When you export an instance in Command Central, the string "Picked" is appended 
to some of the lines in the template. Applying such a template might fail because 
of the appended string.

The issue is resolved. The string "Picked" is no longer appended to any line in the template.


SPM-5609 (SPM_10.15_Core_Fix5)
Software AG Platform Manager now uses version 3.5.53 of the Java Service Wrapper. 
Uninstalling this fix reverts the Tanuki wrapper version to 3.5.50.


CCE-8353 (SPM_10.15_Core_Fix5)
Software AG Command Central uses an outdated version of the
third party component Apache Xmlgraphics batik, which has known security vulnerabilities.

The issue is resolved. The Apache Xmlgraphics batik jar is migrated to the stable 
version 1.17. 


SPM-5482 (SPM_10.15_Core_Fix3)
After creating or updating a Platform Manager HTTPs port configuration using 
the Command Central web user interface, the configured keystore password is 
included in plain text in the Platform Manager wrapper.log file.

The issue is resolved. The keystore password entry is no longer included in 
the Platform Manager wrapper.log.


CCE-7971 (SPM_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Upgrading Platform Manager to version 10.15 fails if the source Platform
Manager has been modified to use the Entrust encryption.

The issue is resolved. You can now upgrade a source Platform Manager that 
uses the Entrust encryption to version 10.15. The required libraries for the 
Entrust encryption are now added to the migration framework in Platform Manager.


8.0 Installation

Use IBM webMethods Command Central to install fixes on multiple machines from a central location (9.7 or later), 
or IBM webMethods Update Manager to install fixes on one machine at a time. For instructions,
see the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are running Command Central on a Windows operating system, and you uninstall Fix 6 or higher to downgrade to Fix 5 or higher, Command Central might fail to start. 
The issue occurs because the Tanuki Java Service Wrapper reverts from version 3.5.53 to version 3.5.50. 
Fix 5 or higher of Command Central reference should reference the newer version of the wrapper, while Fix 4 and lower should reference reference the older version.
Re-registering the Command Central Windows service ensures that Command Central references the correct version of the Tanuki wrapper.
To re-register the Command Central Windows service:
1.Open a command prompt, navigate to the [Software AG_directory]\profiles\CCE\bin directory and run the following command to remove the Command Central service:
service.bat -remove
3.Run the following command to register the Windows service for Command Central:
service.bat -install


Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.


Uninstall using IBM webMethods Command Central or IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, see 
the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.
