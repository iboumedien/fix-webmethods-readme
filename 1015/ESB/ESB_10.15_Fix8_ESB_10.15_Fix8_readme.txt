WED-10682
Designer does not allow setting the Retry interval property to zero when
configuring transient error handling for MQTT, JMS, or webMethods messaging trigger.

When configuring transient error handling for MQTT, JMS, or webMethods messaging
triggers, Designer does not permit a Retry interval value of zero in any unit of
time, including milliseconds, minutes, or years.

This issue is now resolved.


WED-10650
As part of this fix, one of the internal library related to Flat File (ffcore.jar) 
is updated to the latest version.


WED-10594 (ESB_10.15_Fix7)
Error importing the large schemas to create Document assets.
In Designer installed on Linux/Mac OS platforms, an error java.lang.StackOverflowError 
occurs while importing large schemas to create the Document assets.

The issue is resolved. The schema import to create documents on Linux/Mac OS 
platform works fine. 

WED-10446 (ESB_10.15_Fix6)
Designer lacks the option to cache the missing or non-existent nodes.

The lack of an option to cache the missing or non-existent nodes
results in numerous internal service calls from a flow service step
when the referenced document does not exist during pipeline
loading. The frequent service calls impact performance while
rendering the pipeline view for a flow service.

This issue is resolved. Now, Designer provides an option to enable
the cache for non-existent nodes with a cache expiry time set in
Service Development > Package Navigator > Cache. 

WED-10332 (ESB_10.15_Fix5)
Designer erroneously copies code to a subordinate Java service when
copying functions or methods to a service within the Java service editor.

If multiple Java services under the same namespace are open in the Java
service editor, copying functions or methods to a service in the
editor causes the copied code to erroneously appear in a subordinate Java
service instead of the intended service.

This issue is now resolved.


WED-10334 (ESB_10.15_Fix5)
Despite setting the Indentation tab policy to 'spaces only' in the Designer
preferences, the Java service editor allows tab characters in formatted code.

This fix includes changes to ensure that the Java service editor
exclusively uses spaces for indentation, eliminating all tab characters from 
the left indentation of formatted code when the Indentation tab policy
is 'spaces only' for a profile in Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style >
Formatter.

Additionally, this fix resolves the formatting issues encountered while enabling 
or disabling Indented elements > Empty lines for Indentation in 
Window > Preferences >Java > Code Style > Formatter. 


WED-10346 (ESB_10.15_Fix5)
The Java service editor in Designer shows code indentation issues after 
saving any changes.

Modifying Java service source code in the Java service editor and saving the
file or asset in Designer results in an unexpected left indentation of some
lines in the code, especially for the nested lines.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-10267 (ESB_10.15_Fix4)
Designer throws a compilation error while updating a Java service that uses
an old service signature.

In Designer, under Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter,
if "Indentation size" is set to 2 in the active custom profile, a compilation
error occurs while updating a Java service that uses an old service signature 
because Designer duplicates the code for the primary Java service method.
 
This issue is now resolved. 


WED-10177/WED-10157/WED-10216 (ESB_10.15_Fix4)
At times, Designer 10.15 does not display pipeline contents instantly.

During flow service development or debugging, Designer displays the pipeline
contents for an element with a slight delay of one second or less. Typically,
the delay occurs when the pipeline has multiple document references and
transformers in the mappings.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9982 (ESB_10.15_Fix1)
In Designer, lines of code disappear while editing a flow service.

In Designer, consider a flow service with multiple steps such as MAP,
INVOKE, and so on under steps such as SEQUENCE and REPEAT. While
editing the flow service using operations such as Move Left and
Move Right, Designer throws an exception that results in missing code.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-10059 (ESB_10.15_Fix1)
Designer for macOS does not resize the Result view correctly.

When you run a service in Designer, Designer displays
compressed Name and Value columns for the Pipeline tab in the
Results view. Hence, you must manually resize the Result view to
see the results.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-10052 (ESB_10.15_Fix1)
At times, Designer 10.15 does not display pipeline contents instantly.

During flow service development or debugging, Designer displays the pipeline
contents for an element with a slight delay of one second or less. Typically,
the delay occurs when the pipeline has multiple document references and
transformers in the mappings.

This issue is now resolved.
