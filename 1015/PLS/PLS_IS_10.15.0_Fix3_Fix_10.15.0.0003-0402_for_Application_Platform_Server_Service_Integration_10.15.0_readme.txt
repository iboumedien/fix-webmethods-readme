1.0 Fix Name

webMethods Application Platform Server Service Integration 10.15 Fix 3.



2.0 Fix ID

PLS_10.15_IS_Fix3



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects webMethods Application Platform Server 10.15.



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

Fixes are cumulative. Therefore, for each of the listed fixes, you can install the specified fix or 
later.



5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

None.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.


PLS-664  (PLS_10.15_IS_Fix3)

When a JSP page includes a <webm:switch> tag with nested <webm:case> tags, Application Platform
fails to evaluate the <webm:case> tags correctly at runtime and logs the following error:
"ServiceException: Missing switch token for switch tag!"

The issue is resolved.



PLS-659  (PLS_10.15_IS_Fix3)

webMethods Application Platform product support of custom tag libraries is not thread safe.

This issue is resolved. 



PLS-658  (PLS_10.15_IS_Fix3)

The Application Platform runtime libraries now support Apache Tomcat version 9.0.98.



PLS-569  (PLS_10.15_IS_Fix2)

The Application Platform JAAS custom login module does not support logout.  

The issue is resolved. Now, the active session context is logged out and the session cookie is 
invalidated when the JAAS module executes. 

Note: The following Integration Server WATT properties affect session logout behavior. Set the 
properties as shown below:
- watt.security.session.forceReauthOnExpiration=true
- watt.server.auth.cache.enabled=false

For more information about the properties, see the webMethods Integration Server Administrator's Guide.



PLS-568  (PLS_10.15_IS_Fix2)

The Application Platform authorization module attempts to re-register its JAAS implementation if
it cannot be found in the running Integration Server.  The resulting log messages are incorrectly
written at the info level rather than the debug level.

The issue is resolved.



8.0 Installation

Although not required, IS_10.15_Core_Fix17 fix for Integration Server should be installed with this 
fix to resolve PIE-94529.

In rare instances, the following error might be observed when using Designer. 

    Following Error in designer:error"Error creating bundle for project: gateway-collection-types. 
	Details: The JAR/ZIP file (<installPath>\common\runtime\bundles\ext\eclipse\plugins\com.
	springsource.org.apache.tools.ant_1.10.12.jar) seems corrupted, error: Invalid CEN header 
	(invalid extra data field size for tag: 0xef44 at 125)The JAR/ZIP file

	ant_1.10.12.jar) seems corrupted, error: Invalid CEN header (invalid extra data field size 
	for tag: 0xef44 at 125)" 

If this occurs, add the following Java system property to Designer's eclipse.ini file on a 
new line below the other system property settings.  The location in the file is important; 
Designer might not start if this setting is placed elsewhere.
