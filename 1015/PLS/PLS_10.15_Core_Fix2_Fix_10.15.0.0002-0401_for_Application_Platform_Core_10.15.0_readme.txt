None.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.


PLS-658  (PLS_10.15_Core_Fix2)

The Application Platform runtime libraries now support Apache Tomcat version 9.0.98.



PLS-568  (PLS_10.15_Core_Fix1)

The Application Platform authorization module attempts to re-register its JAAS implementation if
it cannot be found in the running Integration Server.  The resulting log messages are incorrectly
written at the info level rather than the debug level.

This issue is resolved.



PLS-576  (PLS_10.15_Core_Fix1)

The Application Platform version 10.15 does not contain the required version of migration scripts.

The issue is resolved. Additionally, the migrate.sh and migrate.bat scripts are updated to reference
the correct log4jv2 system property.



8.0 Installation

Although not required, IS_10.15_Core_Fix17 fix for Integration Server should be installed with this 
fix to resolve PIE-94529.

In rare instances, the following error might be observed when using Designer. 

    Following Error in designer:error"Error creating bundle for project: gateway-collection-types. 
	Details: The JAR/ZIP file (<installPath>\common\runtime\bundles\ext\eclipse\plugins\com.
	springsource.org.apache.tools.ant_1.10.12.jar) seems corrupted, error: Invalid CEN header

If this occurs, add the following Java system property to Designer's eclipse.ini file on a 
new line below the other system property settings.  The location in the file is important; 
Designer might not start if this setting is placed elsewhere.
