5.0 Fix Contents

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the 
release.

LNS-45
Updated copyright notes, vendor, and product names for IBM rebranding.

LNS-32 (LN_6.0_Fix6)
In webMethods Lotus Notes Adapter 6.0, the password entered is 
not masked for Lotus Notes adapter services. 

In the Assign Input Values screen of Lotus Notes adapter services, 
the password entered appears in cleartext. 

This issue is resolved. Now, the password entered is masked.


RGHADPESTBL-1124 (LN_6.0_Fix5)
SUM Adoption for webMethods Lotus Notes Adapter 6.0

LNS-11 (LN_6.0_Fix4)
Output from wm.ln.item:getProperties service displays Object
names instead of Item object properties.

The service wm.ln.item:getProperties is supposed to populate the
expected set of fields in the properties document of the
pipeline. However, it is incorrectly returning an array of
objects in the pipeline properties document.

This issue is resolved. The properties document is now populated
correctly.

LNS-10 (LN_6.0_Fix4)
Service wm.ln.acl:getEntry does not create an output ACL Entry
object; the aclEntry output parameter is null.

During processing, wm.ln.acl:getEntry calls internal service
wm.ln.acl.IMPL:getEntry. In the wm.ln.acl:getEntry service, a new
(but invalid) parameter "aclEntry" was created in the pipeline
mapping, and it does not appear in the output signature of the
wm.ln.acl.IMPL:getEntry service. This incorrect mapping results
in a null value in the "aclEntry" output parameter. This behavior
occurs because "Entry" is not defined in service
wm.ln.acl:getEntry.

This issue is resolved. The mappings have been corrected.

LNS-6 (was 1-1OOBC9) (LN_6.0_Fix3)
Built-in service wm.ln.document:appendItemsFromRecord truncates
last input record.

The wm.ln.document:appendItemsFromRecord service does not append
the last item in the input record to the lotus.domino.Document
to which it is appending the items.
This issue is now resolved, and all input records are correctly
appended to the document.

LNS-5 (was 1-14B9Z1) (LN_6.0_Fix2)
In webMethods Lotus Notes Adapter 6.0, while executing the
wm.ln.item:getText service, the output parameter text is not
available in the output pipeline.

While executing the wm.ln.item:getText service, the output
parameter text of String data type is not available in the
output pipeline. This happens because the input parameters,
item and maxlen, are not mapped to the input variables in the
pipeline.

This issue is now resolved. The wm.ln.item:getText service now
includes the input parameter mappings.

LNS-19 (was 1-13XMTB) (LN_6.0_Fix2)
The "wm.ln.document.getFirstItem" service throws a
java.lang.ClassCastException.

While executing the webMethods Lotus Notes Adapter, the
built-in service "wm.ln.document.getFirstItem", a
java.lang.ClassCastException is thrown. This service casts any
item object as a richtextItem irrespective of the item data
type.

This issue is resolved. The richtextItem is cast through the
richtextItem parameter and the non richtextItem is cast through
the item parameter.

LNS-18 (was 1-W3NP3) (LN_6.0_Fix1)
This fix ensures the webMethods Lotus Notes Adapter 6.0 is
compatible with the webMethods Integration Server 6.5. Without
this fix, users will notice that Lotus Domino session objects
are created without using the user name or password specified in
a connection, and therefore are anonymous sessions. Applying the
fix ensures that session objects are created with the
appropriate credentials.
