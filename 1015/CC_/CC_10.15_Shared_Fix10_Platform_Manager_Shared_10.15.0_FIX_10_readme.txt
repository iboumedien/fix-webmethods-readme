For more information, see section 9.0 Uninstallation. 



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

CCE-9286 (CC_10.15_Shared_Fix9)
When you update a configuration from the Command Central web user interface, Platform Manager
removes properties from the custom_wrapper.conf file that it incorrectly detects as duplicate.
The issue occurs when the custom_wrapper.conf file includes multiple properties with the same
Java option.

The issue is resolved. You can now configure Platform Manager to retain Java options,
such as "--add-opens", even if they appear multiple times in the configuration file. Use the new
"com.softwareag.platform.management.configuration.wrapper.allow.duplicates.for" Java system property
to specify a comma-separated list of options. Default is "--add-opens".

CCE-9290 (CC_10.15_Shared_Fix9)
Command Central might time out and fail to validate, apply, or create a layer definition if you use a
large template.

This issue is resolved.

CCE-9111 (CC_10.15_Shared_Fix9)
Opening a License key in Command Central that has empty Metering data might result in LicenseKeyNotFoundException.
The issue is resolved. License files are loaded and opened successfully.

SPM-5489 (CC_10.15_Shared_Fix3)
When Command Central is installed on a Solaris system, the Command Central logs 
contain the following exception error: "Too many open files".

The issue is resolved. The exception error no longer appears when Command Central 
runs on Solaris.

CCE-7822 (CC_10.15_Shared_Fix1)
In the Command Central web user interface, when creating a new layer in a stack 
and you switch to the credentials properties, the create layer operation fails. 
The new product instance with the selected properties is added in the Installations > Instances, 
but the corresponding layer is not created in the stack. 

The issue is now resolved. 


8.0 Installation

Use IBM webMethods Command Central to install fixes on multiple machines from a central location (9.7 or later), 
or IBM webMethods Update Manager to install fixes on one machine at a time. For instructions,
see the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are running Command Central on a Windows operating system, and you uninstall Fix 6 or higher to downgrade to Fix 5 or higher, Command Central might fail to start. 
The issue occurs because the Tanuki Java Service Wrapper reverts from version 3.5.53 to version 3.5.50. 
Fix 5 or higher of Command Central reference should reference the newer version of the wrapper, while Fix 4 and lower should reference reference the older version.
Re-registering the Command Central Windows service ensures that Command Central references the correct version of the Tanuki wrapper.
To re-register the Command Central Windows service:
1.Open a command prompt, navigate to the [Software AG_directory]\profiles\CCE\bin directory and run the following command to remove the Command Central service:
service.bat -remove
3.Run the following command to register the Windows service for Command Central:
service.bat -install


Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.


Uninstall using IBM webMethods Command Central or IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, see 
the documentation at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products.
