PIF-16215
My webMethods Server reports Derby database errors during startup:
Error while compressing the database: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException:
ALTER TABLE APP.TEvents_MESSAGE
at compressDBByCopy(DerbyMessageStoreMgr.java:164)

This issue occurs only when Tasks are used. Light Weight Queue tries to compress the embedded Derby
database used by Tasks. Database compression fails as the code does not handle mixed-case queue
name. There is no functional impact of this issue.

This issue is resolved.
