2) Create 'administrator' user with a password as 'changeit':
 
POST http://<es_host>:<es_port>/portal_default_umc/_doc/200ceb26-807d-3bf9-9fd6-f4f0d1ca54d4
 
{
    "lastName": "System",
    "hidden": false,
    "index_type": "users",
    "password": "$2a$12$HIGCltNvccUGo5SLVZY0UOSVPYV.I4uq3BtBfg9PVYufF2o9JPr0y",
    "id": "200ceb26-807d-3bf9-9fd6-f4f0d1ca54d4",
    "locked": false,
    "salt": "$2a$12$HIGCltNvccUGo5SLVZY0UO",
    "firstName": "Administrator",
    "name": "administrator",
    "userType": "DEFAULT",
    "groupId": [
        "9870271b-5413-3053-b5b3-12f97a513552"
    ]
}

 3) Reset the 'Administrator' user password

Filtering APIs based on groups in API gallery.

When the groups of an API is modified, then the change is not reflected properly 
on the API gallery page. That is, the API appears under the newly added group and 
the earlier groups as well, even the APIs were removed from the groups.

This issue is now resolved. An API group appears only if it is linked with at 
least one API in the Developer Portal. 

Note: After you upgrade to the latest fix, you must republish APIs that were 
modified. This ensures that the changes are reflected in the UI.

DPO-4153 (Fix 17)
Unable to export API specification from Developer Portal.

When an API is imported using the OpenAPI specification and if you export the 
API definition as JSON/YAML, then the 'Server error 500' appears.

This issue is now resolved.

DPO-4139 (Fix 17)
Access of protected pages to users without any role.

When you have enabled an approval workflow for user onboarding, and if a user 
onboards, Developer Portal creates the profile for that user without any role. 
The corresponding roles are assigned to the users after the onboarding approval. 
In such a scenario, if the newly onboarded user signs in and navigates to the 
"Manage applications" page some static data appears instead of the 
"404-Not found" page.  Also, the user could search for other users without any 
role and share applications with them.

This issue is now resolved. When users without any role access Developer 
Portal and navigate to any protected page, then the "404-Not found" page 
appears. Also, other users cannot share applications with these 
users (without any role).

DPO-4094 (Fix 17)
Query parameters appear in the Callback section of API documentation.

The query parameters defined at the method level appear in the Callback section 
of the method as well.

This issue is now resolved.


DPO-4088 (Fix 16)
When you attempt to sign in with an existing user name the response time is 
longer than the response time taken when you attempt with a non-existing user 
name. Hence, these attempts allow potential user enumeration.

This issue is now resolved.

DPO-3936 (Fix 16)
User enumeration is possible based on a failed error message during sign in.

Since different error messages are displayed for a valid user versus an invalid user 
after certain failed sign in attempts, user enumeration could be performed.

This issue is now resolved. A generic error message is displayed for all failed 
sign in attempts.

DPO-3878 (Fix 16)
If a user creates multiple applications with the same name in Developer Portal 
pointing to a single application in API Gateway then issues occur when the 
Developer Portal data is synchronized with API Gateway.

This issue is now resolved. A user cannot create more than one application with 
the same name.

DPO-3841 (Fix 16)
Connecting the Developer Portal server with Cloud Elasticsearch does not work.

Sniffer is disabled by default from this fix. 

To resolve this issue, add the following entries in the dpo_wrapper.conf:

wrapper.java.additional.2312=-Dspring.elasticsearch.rest.uris=https://<cloud.es.io url>/
wrapper.java.additional.2313=-Dspring.elasticsearch.rest.username=elastic
wrapper.java.additional.2314=-Dspring.elasticsearch.rest.password=<elastic_user password>

wrapper.java.additional.2315=-Dportal.server.config.enable-elasticsearch-sniffer=true

DPO-3866 (Fix 16)
The request body parameter not working as expected when a file is uploaded.

When an API endpoint redirects the request to another endpoint, Developer Portal 
displays the 302 response code instead of the correct response code. 

This issue is now resolved.

DPO-3980 (Fix 16)
Inactive and rejected applications appear on the 'Use existing application' pop-up.

When you request an application from the API details page, the inactive and 
rejected applications also appear on the 'Use existing application' pop-up.

description is displayed as API Summary in Developer Portal. If you make changes
to this summary section using the API Enrich option, and if you republish the API
then the edited text is overridden by the API description that comes from API Gateway.

This issue is now resolved.


DPO-2831 (Fix 14)

DPO-2495 (Fix 10)
Information missing in API details page.

In the API details page of a REST API, the 'possible value' and 'payload type
information' details of parameters do not appear.

This issue is now resolved.


DPO-2523 (Fix 9)
Unable to view all applications.

During application request, if you try to select an application from the 'Request application'
pop-up window then only 12 applications appear in the drop-down.

This issue is now resolved.

DPO-2384 (Fix 9)
Sample section for the array scheme type is not rendered as expected.

When an array scheme type on an API has an example, then the sample section on
the API details page does not appear as expected.

This issue is now resolved.

DPO-2515 (Fix 9)
Restrict consumer visibility based on Community.

When an API consumer searches for a user, then the search result includes the
API consumers that are part of other communities.

This issue is now resolved. The search result displays only the matching records
from the communities that the user belongs to.

You must enable this feature by using the following variable in the 'dpo_wrapper'
config file located in SAGInstallDir\profiles\CTP\configuration:

* wrapper.java.additional.2101=-Dportal.server.config.user-search-community-restricted.

  Possible values are:
  
  - true. When an API consumer perform user search, the result includes matching 
  records only from the communities that the user belongs to.
  - false. The search result includes the matching records from all communities.
  
DPO-2365 (Fix 9)
Changes made to the third-party API Gateway integration.

The following changes are made:

* When a Swagger or Open API specification includes the 'API Key' security definition, and
  if you test that API, the header name in the 'Try API' page does not display 
  the expected value.
  
  This issue is now resolved. The value specified for the api_key name is displayed as 
  the header name on the 'Try API' page. For example, consider the following specification:
  
  securityDefinitions:
  api_key:
    type: apiKey
    name: X-API-Key
    in: header

  For the API with the above specification, the value 'X-API-Key' is displayed as 
  the header name.

* When you delete a third-party application a corresponding event is not generated.

  This issue is now resolved. The "REQUEST_ACCESS_TOKEN" event is written to events log.

* When you delete a third-party application from the UI, It was a soft deletion. 
  Now, You can permanently delete an application using the following REST endpoint:
 - PUT http://localhost:18101/portal/rest/v1/applications/<application_id>?eventId=<event_id>.  


DPO-2359 (Fix 8)
The 'Verify hostname' option in the LDAPS configuration page is not enforced
properly for secured LDAP connections.

This issue is now resolved.

You can enforce hostname verification only when you have enabled certificate
verification.

The 'Verify hostname' option is removed from the UI. Hence, to enable the
hostname verification set the environment variable,
'portal.server.config.disable-host-name-verifier', to 'false'. The default value
of this setting is 'true'.

DPO-2356 (Fix 8)
Login page is not displayed for guest users.

When a guest user accesses the http://localhost:8080/portal/applications page,
a page with static content appears instead of redirecting the user to the
Login page.

This issue is now resolved.

section in the Application details page does not include the access tokens.

This issue is now resolved.
