MWS-37207 (TE_10.15_TE_Fix4)
Logging for CDS & TE inside of IS was different. CDS did not create any logging files and ended up
logging wherever Log4j was setup. Where as TaskEngine@IS created it's own te.log.

To streamline both product's logging inside of IS a common _full_.log(similar to MWS) is
introduced inside the Integration Server's logging directory.
