the corresponding SEF Doctype present in the EDI Module.
 
This issue is resolved.

EEO-5210(EDI_9.12_WmEDI_Fix27)

In IBM webMethods Module for EDI, the default EDITPA resets the field values for
ICheaderInfo/ISA/ISA01, ICheaderInfo/ISA/ISA03, ICheaderInfo/ISA/ISA11,
ICHeaderInfo/GS/GS07, ICHeaderInfo/UNB/UNB01, and ICHeaderInfo/UNB/UNB08 to
their default values if those fields are empty when the integration server
restarts.

adds the UNA segment in the UN/EDIFACT document based on the default behavior 
of the service wm.b2b.edi.util:addICEnvelopeEDIFACT.
 
This issue is resolved. Now, a new input parameter removeUNA is added.  
When you set the value for removeUNA to true, it does not add the UNA segment,  
irrespective of the value configured for the input parameter UNARequired. 

EEO-5113 (EDI_9.12_WmEDI_Fix22)
