such as Designer, Process Engine, Optimize and ESB, and Business Console.


5.0 Platform Support

This fix is supported on all platforms supported by webMethods Monitor.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. For RGHWPE-4389 PostgreSQL database support for Monitor.
Set Default archiving parameter in the OPERATION_PARAMETER table:
        PostgreSQL: Process Audit Log schema name

2. BPM Archival for PostgreSQL database only supports multiple schemas with single db only.
For E.g:

CREATE DATABASE bpmarchive(db name);
 \c bpmarchive;(connect to database)

CREATE SCHEMA processbpm(process schema name);
SET search_path TO processbpm;

-- create user now --
CREATE USER processbpmuser (process schema user);
ALTER USER processbpmuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'manage';
ALTER USER processbpmuser SET search_path = processbpm;

--grant permissions --
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE bpmarchive TO processbpmuser;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA processbpm TO processbpmuser;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA processbpm TO processbpmuser;
--below grants are needed to make sure if user creates new objects in future , grants are
available for them too
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON FUNCTIONS TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON TYPES TO processbpmuser;

--create archive schema now --
CREATE SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm(archive schema name);
SET search_path TO archiveprocessbpm;

-- create user now --
CREATE USER archiveprocessbpmuser(archive schema user) ;
ALTER USER archiveprocessbpmuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'manage';
ALTER USER archiveprocessbpmuser SET search_path = archiveprocessbpm;

--grant permissions --
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE bpmarchive TO archiveprocessbpmuser;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm TO archiveprocessbpmuser;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA processbpm TO archiveprocessbpmuser;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm TO archiveprocessbpmuser;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA processbpm TO archiveprocessbpmuser;

--below grants are needed to make sure if user creates new objects in future , grants are
available for them too --
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO archiveprocessbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO archiveprocessbpmuser;

7.0 Fix Contents

WMN-8804
With webMethods Monitor, the Services queries may exhaust the ISCoreAudit JDBC pool and hang the server. This issue occurs when there is a large volume of records in the audit tables, causing long execution times in SQL Server. To help minimize the impact, the following property can be added to the monitor.cnf file to reduce the effect of locking during these queries:

wm.monitor.mssql.withNoLock=true

This issue is resolved.

WMN-8766 (MON_10.15_Fix7)
In webMethods Monitor, the pub.monitor.archive services fail to archive a PostgresSQL database if the database name contains "db2".

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8767 (MON_10.15_Fix7)
In the Process Instance page of Monitor, when you click Resubmit Closest or Resubmit Earliest, the process instance is not resubmitted and an error appears in the log. The issue occurs when the process model logging level is set to 2 - Errors only.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8748 (MON_10.15_Fix7)
In the Advanced search tab of the Services page, when you apply a filter whose Value parameter is in scientific notation (for example "3E150"), an error occurs.
 
The issue is resolved.

WMN-8733 (MON_10.15_Fix7)
In the Process Instance page of Monitor, the Resubmit Closest button does not resubmit a process instance that was previously resubmitted and in which the failed step is contained in a sub-process.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8720 (MON_10.15_Fix6)
A security vulnerability in the Services page of Monitoring is now fixed.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8475 (MON_10.15_Fix5)
In webMethods Monitor, the My webMethods Server settings might override the Task Client settings.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8362 (MON_10.15_Fix5)
In webMethods Monitor, several API queries consume a lot of memory.

The issue is resolved. The following services are modified so that the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter in monitor.cnf applies to them.

pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceList
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListWithFilter
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomDataSet
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomData
pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList

If you set useExactMatch to True, your search query will return only those INSTANCEID,
PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID results which exactly match your search term. An isExactMatch input parameter is also added to these services. isExactMatch works like the useExactMatch parameter, but takes priority over it.

New parameter reference:
  isExactMatch
  
  This parameter allows you to control whether your search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  
Valid values are:
  false - Default value for isExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  true - If you set isExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID. The query will return only those
  results which exactly match your search term.

WMN-8143 (MON_10.15_Fix5)
In webMethods Monitor, when you view information for a collaboration task step in a webMethods-executed process, the Step Information window does not display a Task Detail link.

If webMethods Monitor uses a PostgreSQL database, the Business Process page performance is very slow, which might result in a timeout exception.
 
The issue is resolved.

WMN-8402 (MON_10.15_Fix4)

wm.monitor.imageCleanupEnabled=false
