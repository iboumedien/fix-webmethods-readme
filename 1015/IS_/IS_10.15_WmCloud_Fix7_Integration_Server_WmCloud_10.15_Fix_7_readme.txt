PIE-87562
Disabling a tenant alias does not effectively disable the accounts associated
with the alias and results in locked accounts on the cloud side.

An account can still receive, process, and reply to requests for on-premise
services from webMethods Cloud when the tenant alias associated with the account
is disabled.

This issue is now resolved by removing the functionality to enable or disable a
tenant connection alias.

PIE-94148
In hybrid integration, the on-premises Integration Server does not log the
connected Realm server details.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-96500
Integration Server experiences high CPU usage when Universal Messaging servers
are stopped in the Horizontal Scaling setup.

The high CPU usage is due to numerous Universal Messaging client sessions 
repeatedly attempting to reconnect to the stopped servers every 2 seconds.

This issue is resolved by distributing UM session re-connections over a period 
of time to prevent CPU spikes, using two newly introduced server configuration 
parameters:

    - watt.server.messaging.um.session.reconnectImmediately: Specifies whether 
      Integration Server reconnects immediately. Set the parameter to true for 
	  an immediate reconnection attempt or false to prevent the attempt. The 
	  default value is true.
    - watt.server.messaging.um.session.reconnectInterval: Specifies the interval 
	  at which Integration Server attempts an immediate reconnection. The 
      default value is 5 seconds. There is no maximum value for this parameter. 
	  The reconnection interval is calculated as the set value plus a random 
	  value between 0 and the set value.
      For example, if there are 10 sessions, session 1 may have an interval of 5 
      seconds, session 2 may have 7 seconds, session 3 may have 9 seconds, and 
      so on. This staggered retry mechanism prevents all sessions from 
	  reconnecting simultaneously, reducing CPU load.

You must restart Integration Server for changes to these parameters to take
effect. 

PIE-98970
The server log displays user credentials in clear text when Integration
Server updates the transport configuration used to connect to IBM
webMethods Integration (SaaS).

Now, Integration Server masks user credentials in server log messages.

PIE-99213
Integration Server supports OAuth token-based authentication for hybrid
connections. 

You can now enable OAuth token-based authentication for hybrid connections while
creating tenant aliases on an on-premises Integration Server using OAuth tokens.
In Integration Server Administrator > webMethods Cloud > Tenant Connections >
Create Tenant Connection, select Token as the authentication type, and enter the
authentication token generated from IBM webMethods Integration for hybrid
connectivity instead of basic authentication. 

PIE-81603 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix6)
Removing idle listeners for Cloud on an on-premises Integration Server may cause
a session leak. 
 
Applying a WmCloud fix or upgrading to a release that included PIE-61850
resulted in Integration Server monitoring on-premises listeners to ensure that
each enabled webMethods Cloud account had an active listener. If the monitoring
thread found a listener that was not running, the monitoring thread attempted to
start the listener. Integration Server used the
watt.wmcloud.listeners.maxIdleTime value to determine the length of time a
listener could be idle before being recreated. However, when removing the idle
listener, Integration Server did not properly close the connection for the
listener it was removing. Over a period of time, the leaked connections build up
on the Cloud and cause issues. 
 
To address this issue, Integration Server no longer uses a thread to remove idle
listeners and their associated connections. The listeners for Cloud accounts can
reconnect automatically so it is no longer necessary to dedicate a thread to
replacing the listener if it becomes idle. As a result, the
watt.wmcloud.listeners.maxIdleTime is now obsolete. Integration Server ignores
watt.wmcloud.listeners.maxIdleTime if the parameter exists in the server.cnf. 
 
In addition to the above change, the maximum value of
watt.wmcloud.listeners.monitoringinterval is now 300000 (5 minutes).
Integration Server resets watt.wmcloud.listeners.monitoringinterval to 300000 (5
minutes) if it was set to higher value. 

PIE-94775 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix6)
Integration Server allows users to create tenant connections with 
invalid and malicious data.

In Integration Server Administrator > WmCloud > Create Tenant Connections, when
creating a tenant connection, Integration Server 
accepts invalid data, which results in tenant connections containing malicious
content and leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server validates the data 
before creating tenant connections.

PIE-96791 and PIE-94375
Improvements to the performance and scalability of hybrid invocation.

In hybrid invocation, webMethods.io invokes a service that resides on an 
on-premises Integration Server. The on-premises Integration Server executes the 
requested service and sends a response to webMethods.io.
The communication backbone for hybrid invocation is a Universal Messaging server 
that the IBM Site Reliability Engineering team deploys and manages (previously, 
this team might have been named the webMethods.io Cloud Operations or simply 
Cloud Ops).

To optimize the performance and scalability of hybrid invocation, Integration 
Server introduces enhancements in the following areas:

- Horizontal scalability. Hybrid integration can use multiple Universal 
  Messaging servers, ensuring that workloads can be distributed across multiple 
  servers for better resource utilization and reliability. A single tenant can 
  communicate with one or more Universal Messaging servers.
  
- Session pooling. A session pooling mechanism supported across multiple 
  Universal Messaging servers can be used with the webMethods.io and on-premises 
  Integration Server. This mechanism ensures that NHP (the HTTP protocol for 
  Universal Messaging) efficiently handles requests and replies in a
  scalable manner, regardless of deployment environment.
  
- Runtime scale up and scale down. Universal Messaging servers can be added and 
  removed dynamically by the IBM Site Reliability Engineering team, without 
  causing an interruption in the current processing or requiring a configuration 
  change. This capability allows hybrid integration to adjust resources based on 
  demand, enhancing flexibility and improving resource management.

To support the enhanced hybrid invocation capabilities, an on-premises 
Integration Server includes changes to Integration Server Administrator and 
server configuration parameters, specifically:

- Option to reload transport configuration for a tenant connection.

  The webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections page in Integration Server 
  Administrator now has a Reload Transport Configuration column. Click the icon 
  in this column to reload the Universal Messaging transport configuration for a 
  specific tenant. Integration Server connects to webemthods.io to retrieve the 
  latest Universal Messaging transport configuration. If the updated configuration
  includes changes to the URL for the Universal Messaging servers, Integration 
  Server reloads the existing session pools (consumer and producer) and 
  listeners without interrupting any current hybrid invocation processing. For 
  example, if the transport configuration changes include a new URL for Universal 
  Messaging, Integration Server dynamically adjusts the session pools and listeners
  to use the new URLs by adding new sessions to the pool and creating new listener. 
  If the transport configuration change includes removal of a URL, Integration 
  Server slowly removes sessions and listeners that use the removed URL.
  
  Note: You can also reload the Universal Messaging transport configuration by 
  clicking Updates Settings on the webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections > Edit 
  tenant connection page. Integration Server obtains the updated transport 
  configuration, shuts down the existing Universal Messaging listeners and 
  session pools for the tenant, and then restarts all Universal Messaging 
  listeners and session pools for the tenant. Any in-flight requests will be lost.
  
- Session pool configuration parameters. For each webMethods Cloud account, the 
  on-premises Integration Server now maintains a consumer session pool for 
  receiving requests from webMethods.io and a producer session pool for sending 
  responses to webMethods.io. Use the following server configuration parameters
  to determine the maximum size of the session pools.

  - watt.wmcloud.consumer.sessionPool.count
    Specifies the maximum number of sessions for the on-premises consumer 
	session pool for each webMethods Cloud account. Consumer pool sessions 
	receive request messages from webMethods.io. Each session in this pool 
	corresponds to a dedicated message listener. The minimum value is 1.
    The default value is 1.

  - watt.wmcloud.producer.sessionPool.count
    Specifies the maximum number of sessions for the on-premises producer 
	session pool for each webMethods Cloud account. Producer pool sessions send 
	responses for hybrid invocations to webMethods.io. Each session in the pool 
	is associated with a socket on the Universal Messaging server. The minimum 
	value is 1. The default value is 5.

The following server configuration parameters have been replaced by watt.wmcloud.consumer.sessionPool.count and watt.wmcloud.producer.sessionPool.count:

- watt.wmcloud.um.sessionPool.config
- watt.wmcloud.sessionPool.maxCount

The following server configuration parameters are obsolete because the new 
hybrid invocation capabilities do not use the parameters:

- watt.wmcloud.sendResponse.retryCount
- watt.wmcloud.sendResponse.retryDelay
- watt.wmcloud.sendResponse.transactional
- watt.wmcloud.sessionPool.minCount
- watt.wmcloud.sessionPool.sweeperInterval
- watt.wmcloud.um.event.waitTime
- watt.wmcloud.um.sessionPool.maxCount
- watt.wmcloud.um.sessionPool.minCount
- watt.wmcloud.umsession.maxlimit

There is no replacement for these parameters. While the parameters may still 
appear in server.cnf, Integration Server does not use the parameters.

PIE-84992 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix5)
In the legacy Integration Server Administrator, disabling an On-Premise Account 
under webMethods Cloud fails because the Stage value is incorrect.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-86351 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix5)
Health indicator information for troubleshooting purposes.

The HybridConnections health indicator information includes individual statuses 
for tenant connections and associated accounts, sessions, and stage along with
the overall hybrid connection status. The current session for an account is the 
number of active sessions between the On-premise Integration Server and 
webmethods Cloud. You can use the health indicator information for 
troubleshooting purposes.

PIE-87692 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix5)
The on-premise Integration Server monitors the tenant connection status at a 
regular interval of 10 minutes, increasing the load on webMethods Cloud.
 
The wm.client.integrationlive.admin:scheduleTenantMonitoringTask task 
runs in the on-premise Integration Server at the specified interval of 
10 minutes to monitor the tenant connection status. Since the hybrid 
connectivity alerts are managed by webMethods Cloud, the on-premise 
Integration Server does not have to perform the monitoring that 
increases the load on webMethods Cloud.

This issue is now resolved. Now, the on-premise Integration Server does not 
handle the alerts for tenant connections. 

PIE-81971 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
A Cloud account cannot be deleted on the on-premise Integration Server if the
tenant on webMethods Cloud is not available. 

A cloud configuration change, such as deleting an account, made on the
on-premise Integration Server cannot complete if the on-premise server cannot
connect to the tenant on the Cloud. 

Now, Integration Server continues with on-premise configuration changes related
to Cloud without requiring a successful response from the Cloud tenant. Changes
to cloud accounts, applications, and the tenant connection alias can be made on
the on-premise Integration Server and then pushed to the Cloud. However, if a
connection to the Cloud is not available, the cloud configuration on the
on-premise Integration Server becomes out of sync with the Cloud tenant. To get
the items on Cloud synchronized with the on-premise configuration, edit the
account or application in the Cloud. 

PIE-82574 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
Under heavy load, an on-premises Integration Server might take a long time to 
send responses to the Cloud.

Previously, each webMethods Cloud account on an on-premises Integration Server 
used a single session to send responses to the Cloud. Under heavy load, this 
configuration might create resource contention and increase response time.

To address this issue, an on-premises Integration Server now creates a session 
pool for each webMethods Cloud account and uses sessions in the pool to send 
responses to the Cloud. The server configuration parameter 
watt.wmcloud.um.sessionPool.maxCount determines the maximum number of sessions 
in the pool. The default value is 3.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to 
take effect. However, the webMethods Cloud accounts on the on-premises 
Integration Server must be disabled and then enabled for changes to the 
parameter to take effect.

PIE-83656 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
When multiple webMethods Cloud accounts with the same alias are associated with
multiple tenants, surplus sessions are created. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-83687 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
A session leak may occur if the Enable link is repeatedly clicked for an enabled
account on the WmCloud > Accounts page in Integration Server Administrator. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-84595 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
Session leak may occur when constantly refreshing the webMethods Cloud >
Accounts page. 

Repeatedly clicking the link in the Enabled column for an account on the
webMethods Cloud > Accounts page may cause a session leak for the Universal
Messaging server used to route messages to and from the tenant for the
on-premises Integration Server. 

Now, if an action results in the change to an account's enabled status, the
link in the Enabled column is disabled until the action completes. 

PIE-84618 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
A tenant connection alias that specified a non-existent webMethods Cloud URL was
created as enabled but should be disabled. 

When using the webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections page to create a tenant
connection alias, specifying an invalid URL for the webMethods Cloud URL results
in an enabled tenant connection alias but should not. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-84855 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
Integration Server Administrator displays an incomplete message when deleting a
tenant. 

After attempts to delete a tenant on the webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections
page, Integration Server Administrator displays just the name of the tenant
without any context. This can be confusing if the tenant connection cannot be
deleted because it is being used by an account. 

Now Integration Server Administrator displays clearer error messages when
attempts to delete a connection alias succeed or fail. 

PIE-84873 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
Integration Server experiences a delay while updating tenant connections.
 
When you update settings in Integration Server Administrator > webMethods Cloud
> Tenant connections, Integration Server refreshes all available account 
connections, irrespective of the updated tenant. As a result, updating settings
leads to a delay in re-establishing connections to webMethods Cloud.
 
This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server refreshes only the account 
connections associated with the updated tenant.

PIE-85000 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
Hybrid requests might fail because of a NullPointerException that sometimes
occurs after disabling and then enabling a webMethods Cloud account on an
on-premises Integration Server. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-85142 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix4)
When webMethods Cloud is unreachable, disabling a webMethods Cloud account
results in an open response session, leading to session leakage. 
 
This issue is resolved. Now, when you disable a webMethods Cloud account, 
the on-premise Integration Server closes the response session irrespective 
of the webMethods Cloud status.

PIE-81694 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix3)
Integration Server logs the "Unable to create an SMTP client instance for a 
hybrid connectivity alert: The email properties are not configured." error when 
an account or tenant connection is disconnected or restored. 

Integration Server uses the email notification settings configured in 
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Resources to send the hybrid 
connectivity alert mails to the user. If the email notification settings are 
not configured, and the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications 
server configuration parameter has a value other than 'alert' or 'none', 
Integration Server logs the error when an account or tenant connection is 
disconnected or restored. 

This issue is now resolved. Now, the default value of 
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications server configuration 
parameter is 'alert'.

PIE-83185 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix3)
Integration Server Administrator exposes tenant connection passwords.

In Integration Server Administrator > webmethods Cloud > Tenant connections, the
password used to create a tenant connection is exposed while editing the
connection. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-84255 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix3)
The on-premise Integration Server now provides an option to enable or disable 
payload compression for communication with webMethods Cloud.

In Integration Server Administrator, go to webMethods Cloud > Accounts, and 
select the Enable Compression option. By default, the option is not selected. 
Compression is enabled only if both the on-premise Integration Server and 
webMethods Cloud installations are configured to use the compression 
functionality. If webMethods Cloud does not perform compression, then on-premise 
Integration Server returns the payload in its original, uncompressed form.
Compressing payloads smaller than 5KB leads to slight decrease in throughput. It 
is recommended to disable compression for file types such as PDFs, zip files, 
and so on to maintain optimal throughput.

Note:
If you enable compression for an existing account, you must upload the account 
for the changes to take effect.

PIE-81048 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix2)
Integration Server stores duplicate queue information while creating a 
tenant for webMethods Cloud.

While creating a tenant connection, Integration Server stores the queue 
information in the accounts.cnf file. However, Integration 
Server stores the same queue information twice in the "queues" 
and "queueNames" records resulting in duplicate entries.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server stores the 
queue information in the "queueNames" record in the accounts.cnf file.

PIE-81176 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix2)
Integration Server now provides alerts for hybrid connectivity.

A new channel, "Hybrid Connections" is added for hybrid connectivity alerts,
which are generated for the following events:

- Tenant connection disconnected
- Tenant connection restored
- Account disconnected
- Account restored

When an account connection or a tenant connection is disconnected or restored,
Integration Server notifies the user through a notification in Integration
Server Administrator followed by an email.
You can configure the hybrid connectivity notifications using
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications server configuration
parameter and the recipients of the notification emails using 
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail server configuration parameter.

Integration Server uses the email notification settings configured in
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Resources. 

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail
Specifies the list of email addresses to which Integration Server sends emails
about errors and warnings related to the connection status between Integration
Server and webMethods Cloud. Use a semicolon (;) as a delimiter to specify
multiple email addresses. By default, the parameter value is blank.

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications
Specifies whether Integration Server generates notifications and notifies users
when a tenant connection or an account for webMethods Cloud is disconnected or
restored. The parameter can have one of the following values:

- alert: Integration Server displays a notification in Integration Server
Administrator.
- email: Integration Server sends an email to the user.
- none: Integration Server does not notify the user.

Note: If you are using any value other than alert, email, or none, Integration 
Server notifies the user through a notification in Integration Server 
Administrator, followed by an email. By default, the parameter value is blank.

Integration Server restart is not required for changes to these parameters to 
take effect.

In addition, the HybridConnections health indicator is added to track the status
of hybrid connections.
HybridConnections: Checks all the listed tenant connection
aliases and associated accounts for webMethods Cloud. Returns a status of UP if
all of the listed tenant connections and associated accounts are UP.
Returns a status of DOWN if any of the listed tenant or account connections are
down. The health indicator includes individual statuses for tenant connections
and associated accounts, along with the overall hybrid connection status.
If an enabled tenant connection does not have an account alias or the account
alias is not enabled, the health indicator does not list the tenant alias.
If a tenant connection is disabled and the associated account is enabled, the
health indicator shows the account status.

PIE-78153 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
Service executions on the on-premise Integration Server result in 
increased logging in the server log.

For example:
[ISS.0021.8018I] Received request ID <REQ_ID> to execute service 
<SERVICE_NAME> for application <APP_NAME> using account <ACCOUNT_NAME>.
[ISS.0021.8020I] Executed service <SERVICE_NAME> for request ID <REQ_ID>. 
Session ID: <SESSION_ID>.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server logs the service execution 
details only when you set the WmCloud logging facility to the Trace level.

PIE-78298 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
Service executions on an on-premise Integration Server result in increased 
logging in the server log. 

During WmCloud package startup, Integration Server may log an error message 
like the following: 

<timestamp> [ISS.0028.0012I] (tid=<thread id>) WmCloud: Startup service (
wm.client.integrationlive.admin:loadTenantAccountInfo) 

<timestamp> }}{{{} \\\ISS.0021.6004E\\\{} (tid=<thread id>) An error occurred 
while loading information from the webMethods Cloud environment. No tenant 
aliases are enabled. 

This error message is meaningful only if Integration Server is used as an on-
premise server with webMethods Cloud. This message can be safely ignored if it 
occurs on an Integration Server that is not used with webMethods Cloud. 

This issue is resolved. Now, the log level for several log messages produced by 
Integration Server during startup is adjusted. ISS.0021.6004 is no longer 
an error when all cloud tenants are disabled. Additionally, no INFO log 
messages are produced when an on-premise service executes. Set the logging 
level for the Integration Cloud (0021) logging facility to DEBUG to produce log 
messages with each service execution.

PIE-78317 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
Integration Server allows uploading applications to Integration Cloud 
through a disabled tenant connection.

Integration Server requires a tenant connection that is valid and 
enabled to upload applications to Integration Cloud. However, 
Integration Server Administrator displays a successful message while 
uploading an application for a disabled tenant connection.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server displays the 
"Tenant connection is not enabled." message for a disabled tenant 
connection.

PIE-78419 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
Session leak when Universal Messaging server used for hybrid connectivity is
missing a required queue. 
 
When the Universal Messaging server that facilitates communication between the
on-premises Integration Server and webMethods Cloud is missing a required queue
(specifically the queue from which the on-premises Integration Server retrieves
requests from webMethods Cloud), the on-premise Integration Server continually
attempts to reconnect resulting in sessions that are neither disposed of nor
closed. This leads to a constant accumulation of open connections which
eventually leads to resource exhaustion and Universal Messaging server becoming
unresponsive. 

Now, when a required Universal Messaging queue is missing, the on-premises
Integration Server closes sessions that attempted to establish a connection to
the missing queue. This prevents the accumulation of sessions and resource
exhaustion. 

PIE-78523 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
System packages include JAR files for third party libraries that already exist
in the <IntegrationServer>\lib\jars directory. 

The code/jars/static directory in some webMethods system packages (WmAdmin,
WmCloud, and WmIntegrationLiveServer) contain third-party JAR files already in
the <IntegrationServer>\lib\jars directory. This is unnecessary as system
packages should rely on JAR files already present in the Integration Server
installation library. 

This issue is now resolved. After applying a fix that includes PIE-78523, the
system packages will no longer contain the duplicated JAR files. 

PIE-78577 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
When an on-premise Integration Server establishes a session with webMethods
Cloud to send a response, an error, such as a missing queue, results in the
session remaining open instead of being closed. 

Now, if an error occurs when establishing a session to send a response to
webMethods Cloud, the on-premise Integration  Server closes the session,
preventing session leaks. 

PIE-78790 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
A webMethods Cloud account on an on-premise Integration Server waits for 
15 minutes before reconnecting to webMethods Integration Cloud, 
resulting in increased downtime.

Integration Server uses the value of the Maximum Reconnection Attempts 
field specified in webMethods Cloud > Accounts > Create On-Premise 
Account > Account Settings to limit the reconnection attempts. 
By default, Integration Server makes five attempts to reconnect to 
webMethods Integration Cloud after waiting for a random time that 
ranges between 1 to 15 minutes, resulting in increased downtime.

The issue is resolved. Now, the account frequently attempts to
reconnect to webMethods Cloud with a random interval between
100 milliseconds to 10 seconds for the first two minutes and
then waits for a period of 30 to 60 seconds before attempting
to retry the connection.

PIE-78830 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
webMethods.io Integration requests time out without an error message.

In a hybrid integration environment, a request from webMethods.io Integration
to an on-premise Integration Server fails when the response payload exceeds
the configured maximum buffer size. However, Integration Server does not
send the exception to webMethods.io Integration but retries to send the
response based on the watt.wmcloud.sendResponse.retryCount server
configuration parameter and then fails. Hence, webMethods.io Integration
requests time out without an exception.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server does not retry publishing
the response when the response exceeds the maximum buffer size
but sends an exception to webMethods.io Integration.

PIE-78907 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
webMethods Cloud requests fail with timeout errors when request timeout is set
to 5 minutes or higher.

After applying a WmCloud fix that contains PIE-75389, webMethods Cloud accounts
that use a request timeout value of 300000 milliseconds (i.e. 5 minutes) or higher
cannot receive Cloud requests. The requests fail with the following exception:

"com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nTransactionException: The time out specified exceeds 
the servers"

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-80374 (IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix1)
Integration Server uses one-way SSL to connect to webMethods Cloud even though
two-way SSL is configured. 

Even though Integration Server and webMethods Cloud are configured for two-way
SSL, Integration Server switches to one-way SSL. 

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server uses two-way SSL to connect to 
Cloud when it is configured.
