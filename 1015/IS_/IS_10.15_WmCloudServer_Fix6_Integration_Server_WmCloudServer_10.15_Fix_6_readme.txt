7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-85481
Enabling dynamic queues by setting watt.server.wmcloud.createResponseQueue=true 
results in performance degradation in Integration Server.

Integration Server creates dynamic queues with a spindle size of 1000, leading 
to performance degradation during high loads with small events, as the spindles 
are created frequently.

This issue is now resolved. Dynamic queues now have a default spindle size of
10000. 

Integration Server now provides the watt.wmcloud.um.listeners.spindleSize
server configuration parameter to specify the spindle size. The default value is
10000. 
You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-87486 (IS_10.15_WmCloudServer_Fix5)
Removed unused code segments to enhance code optimization.

PIE-85723 (IS_10.15_WmCloudServer_Fix4)
Internal updates to Integration Server to support internal changes to webMethods
Cloud (webmethods.io). 

BIC-21811

PIE-84255 (IS_10.15_WmCloudServer_Fix3)
The on-premise Integration Server now provides an option to enable or disable 
payload compression for communication with webMethods Cloud.

In Integration Server Administrator, go to webMethods Cloud > Accounts, and 
select the Enable Compression option. By default, the option is not selected. 
Compression is enabled only if both the on-premise Integration Server and 
webMethods Cloud installations are configured to use the compression 
functionality.
If webMethods Cloud does not perform compression, then on-premise Integration 
Server returns the payload in its original, uncompressed form.
Compressing payloads smaller than 5KB leads to slight decrease in throughput. 
It is recommended to disable compression for file types such as PDFs, zip files, 
and so on to maintain optimal throughput.

Note:
If you enable compression for an existing account, you must
upload the account for the changes to take effect.
