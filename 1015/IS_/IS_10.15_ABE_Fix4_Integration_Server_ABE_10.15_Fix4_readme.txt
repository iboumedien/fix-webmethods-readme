1.0 Fix Name

webMethods Integration Server Asset Build Environment 10.15 Fix 4



2.0 Fix ID

IS_10.15_ABE_Fix4



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

webMethods Integration Server Asset Build Environment 10.15



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

None.



5.0 Platform Support

webMethods Integration Server Asset Build Environment 10.15 Fix 2 is supported 
on the same platforms and operating systems and with the same JREs as webMethods 
Integration Server Asset Build Environment 10.15.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

To fully resolve PIE-77771, you must also install webMethods Integration Server 
10.15 Core Fix 3 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3). Carefully review the PIE-77771 description 
for information about resolving issues that may appear after applying PIE-77771 
as it upgrades the maverick-client-1.7.23.jar to 1.7.34.

To avoid unnecessary errors, you must install the latest Integration Server 
10.15 Core Fix along with this fix.



7.0 Fix Contents

PIEAR-2571
In Asset Build Environment(ABE), a null pointer exception is shown when a package
containing a newly created unscheduled polling notification is built.

The issue is now resolved.

PIE-87446
The SFTP Version 2 client in Integration Server does not support Public key 
authentication with ED25519 keys.

The maverick JAR used in Integration Server for the SFTP Version 2 client is now 
upgraded from 1.7.34 to 1.7.55

PIE-75291(IS_10.15_ABE_Fix3)
Repository-based package deployments reset the existing ACL configurations to
"Default" on the target Integration Server.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-82709(IS_10.15_ABE_Fix3)
As part of this fix, Integration Server supports creating global variables at 
the server level or package level. All services in Integration Server have
access to a server-level global variable, while a package-level global variable 
is only accessible by services within the package that has the global variable 
defined.

You can create global variables using Integration Server Administrator. In 
Settings > Global variables, add a package to which you can save the global 
variable definition. If you specify a package, Integration Server creates a 
package-level global variable; else Integration Server creates a server-level 
global variable. 

The location where Integration Server saves a global variable depends on 
whether it is a server-level or package-level global variable.

For server-level global variables, the variable definition is saved in:
Integration Server_directory\instances\instance_name\config\globalVariables.cnf

For package-level global variables, the variable definition is saved in the 
package in:
Integration
Server_directory\instances\instance_name\packages\package_name\config\ 
globalVariables.cnf
When Integration Server encounters global variable substitution during service 
execution, Integration Server first looks for the global variable defined at the 
package level. If not found, Integration Server looks for the global variable 
at the server level. 

However, you can override this default behavior by specifying whether the 
service must use a server-level or a package-level global variable. To use 
a server-level global variable, prefix the variable name like this: 
%server:variablename%. To use a package-level global variable, prefix the 
variable name like this: %package:variablename%.

The server-level or package-level global variables can be created or edited 
using the configuration variables template. The assets and property names that 
correspond to the key names in the template are as follows:

Asset: Global Variable (Package-Level)
Property: Value, Key Name: globalvariable.packageName.globalVariableName.value
Property: Is Password?, Key Name:
globalvariable.packageName.globalVariableName.isSecure 
Set to true to indicate the global variable is secure or a password. 
Asset: Global Variable (Server-Level)    
Property: Value, Key Name: globalvariable.globalVariableName.value
Property: Is Password?, Key Name: globalvariable.globalVariableName.isSecure
           Set to true to indicate the global variable is secure or a password.

PIEAR-2244(IS_10.15_ABE_Fix3)
In Asset Build Environment(ABE), building a webMethods Integration Server
package, which contains an updated webMethods Adapter for SAP connection, fails 
with a null value exception.

The issue is now resolved.

PIE-77771 (IS_10.15_ABE_Fix2)
Integration Server throws the following error while connecting to an SFTP 
server: "com.wm.app.b2b.server.sftp.client.SFTPClientException: 
com.sshtools.publickey.InvalidPassphraseException: 
com.maverick.ssh.SshIOException". 

Consider that Integration Server uses the newer SFTP client (version 2) and the 
ED25519 type SSH key pair to connect to an SFTP server. The connection fails 
with SFTPClientException as the maverick-client-1.7.23.jar used by the SFTP 
client lacks support for the ED25519 key signature and SFTP servers that 
support crypto policy. 

This issue is resolved. Applying the fix upgrades the maverick-client-
1.7.23.jar to 1.7.34, which supports the ED25519 key signature. However, the 
upgraded SFTP client does not support authentication keys in the SSH2 format. 
Additionally, the hmac-sha256, hmac-sha256@ssh.com, hmac-sha512, hmac-
sha512@ssh.com, hmac-ripemd160, hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com, hmac-ripemd160-
etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms are not supported. Therefore, for an existing 
server alias, exclude the unsupported MAC algorithms, fetch the host key, and 
save the changes. 

The newer SFTP client (version 2) supports OpenSSH format host keys, and the 
existing key may be in the unsupported SSH2 format. Therefore, testing the 
server alias may throw an error. To avoid the error, regenerate the host key in 
the OpenSSH format, and use the "Get Host Key" button to get the regenerated 
key for the server alias. Similarly, fetch the latest host key if you are 
migrating from an older version of Integration Server, or updating a server 
alias in Integration Server Administrator. 

Once the server alias is successfully created or updated, test whether the user 
alias works with the host key. If testing the user alias results in 
java.security.NoSuchProviderException, add the 
org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider security provider class in 
Integration Server Administrator > Security > Keystore > Add Security Provider.

PIE-78262 (IS_10.15_ABE_Fix1)
When building design-time assets, Asset Build Environment (ABE) ignored the JVM
version for the asset itself and instead used the JVM version from the ABE
environment. 

This is now fixed. The correct JVM version is used for the asset in the
manifest.rel file created by ABE.

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, 
or language as specified in the webMethods Installation Guide. It was not
