same platforms and operating systems and with the same JREs as webMethods 
Integration Server 10.15.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

If Integration Server uses central user management which is provided through My 
webMethods Server, you must keep the common libraries provided by My webMethods 
Server up to date. To obtain the current changes to the common libraries, install 
the latest My webMethods Server fix located under Common Libraries in IBM 
webMethods Update Manager.

IS_10.15_Core_Fix18 (or higher) and IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix4 (or higher) are 
interdependent. Therefore, install both the fixes together.

IS_10.15_Core_Fix18 (or higher) and IS_10.15_WmCloud_Fix5 (or higher) are 
interdependent. Therefore, install both the fixes together.

After installing fix IS_10.15_Core_Fix12 (or higher) and its required dependent 
fixes (CJP_10.15_Fix354 or higher), Integration Server 10.15 uses Azul Java 
version 17.50 for runtime. All future fixes for Integration Server will require 
and work on Java 17 runtime only. Products running on AIX use IBM Semeru Java 
17.0.9.

IS_10.15_Core_Fix20 (or higher) depends on TPP_10.15_BaseSecurity_Fix2 and 
ZSL_10.15_Fix2. Integration Server does not start if these two fixes are not 
installed. In addition, IBM Update Manager installs all three fixes automatically.

IS_10.15_Core_Fix21 (or higher) and Web Services Stack Core 10.15.0 Fix 11 (or 
higher) fixes are interdependent. Apply them together to fully resolve PIE-97963.



7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-100280
Integration Server now includes container script options and an environment
variable to control where the Integration Server running in a container writes
audit logs to the files system and the console. 

When creating an Integration Server image using the is_container script, use the
-Dlog <destination> argument to specify where Integration Server writes the
server log information for this session. Specify one of the following for
<destination>: 

- <filename>: Specify the fully qualified path or relative path to the file in
which you want the server to write server log information for this session.
Relative path is relative to the Integration Server home directory: Integration
Server_directory \instances\<instance_name> 
The filename must specify a directory and filename.  The default destination is
controlled by the watt.debug.logfile server configuration parameter 

- none: Write server log information to the computer screen (STDOUT).Server log
messages written to STDOUT include the identifier “ISSERVER” to help
differentiate server log messages from other messages written to the console. 

- both: Write server log information to the computer screen (STDOUT) and to the
destination specified by the watt.debug.logfile parameter. This is the default
value 

Use -Dlogformat <format> argument to specify JSON as the format to which
Integration Server converts the server log and audit log entries written to the
console (STDOUT or computer screen). Specify <format> as json. Integration
Server supports only "json" format. 

When starting a container for an Integration Server image, use the
WM_IS_LOG_DESTINATION environment variable to override the log destination
specified in the image. The WM_IS_LOG_DESTINATION environment variable has the
same possible values as the -Dlog <destination> argument described above. 

To specify that a container use the JSON format for server log entries and audit
log entries, when starting a container for Integration Server image, set the
LOG_FORMAT environment variable to json. 

PIE-100687
REST requests or responses fail when date fields include a time component
(yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss) instead of using the expected date-only format
(yyyy-MM-dd). 

Integration Server strictly enforces the yyyy-MM-dd format for properties
defined as string with format: date. When clients send date-time values
(2025-11-03T00:00:00), Integration Server, acting as a provider, fails to parse
them, resulting in REST validation errors and payload rejection. As a consumer,
Integration Server encounters invalid datatype errors when it receives such
values in responses. 

This issue is now resolved by adding the watt.server.rest.dateFormat.strict
server parameter. 

watt.server.rest.dateFormat.strict

Specifies how strictly Integration Server validates date strings in REST APIs.
When set to true, Integration Server enforces the yyyy-MM-dd format for
properties defined as string with format: date. When set to false, the server
accepts both yyyy-MM-dd and yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss formats, allowing limited
flexibility. The default value is true. 
You do not need to restart Integration Server for this parameter change to take
effect. 

PIE-101109
The bc-fips, bcmail-fips, bcpg-fips, and bcpkix-fips JARs in Integration Server
are upgraded to address the security vulnerability CVE-2025-8916.

PIE-101442
Integration Server throws Access Denied exception during SOAP requests because
sessions created for these calls are not stored in the 
cluster (Terracotta Server Array) and are removed after processing.

The session handling logic causes this issue because it skips saving the SOAP
sessions in the cluster (Terracotta Server Array).

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-101863
The jcode utility in Integration Server throws a compilation error while
compiling a Java service.

The classpath in the jcode utility does not include all the JAR files
necessary to compile services that depend on external libraries.
As a result, service compilation fails.

This issue is resolved. Now, the jcode utility includes the JARs
from the Integration Server classpath.

PIE-101910
In a cluster, a request to validate an OAuth access token returns an OAuth token
that has been deleted. 

In a cluster, an OAuth token deleted on one server might still be in the local
cache of another server. A request to validate an access token might result in
Integration Server returning a deleted token. 

To resolve this issue, when an Integration Server in a cluster receives a
request to validate an access token, the Integration Server first checks if the
access token is available in the shared database. If the token is not there,
Integration Server checks to see if the token in in the local cache. If it is,
Integration Server removes the token from the local caches. This prevents
Integration Server from returning a deleted token from the local cache. 

PIE-101913
When the cached service output has no signature output fields, the cache
includes the whole pipeline even when strict mode is enabled for service
caching. 

The behavior of service caching with strict caching enabled is now modified to
return an empty pipeline when the cached service output does not contain
signature output fields. To enable the modified behavior, use the new
watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict.returnOutputSigOrEmpty parameter. 

When strict caching is enabled and the
watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict.returnOutputSigOrEmpty parameter is set
to "true", the flow service returns an empty pipeline. The default value is
false. If this parameter is set to false, the output returns the default
pipeline when the pipeline does not contain signature output fields. If you have
run the flow service without the new parameter, you must reset the cache to
enable the new behavior. For details about resetting the cache, see the topic
about caching service results in the Integration Server documentation. You can
also restart Integration Server to clear the cache. 

PIE-101914
The pub.security:decrypt and pub.security:decryptAndVerify services fail with
the error: The service could not retrieve the secret key.

This issue occurs when the encrypted data contains multiple public key encrypted
data packets, and the pgpSecretKey is not found in the first packet.

The issue is now resolved. 

PIE-102010
The assets page in the Integration Server Administrator console
allows access without authentication.

The Administrator console exposes an assets endpoint at
<http://<hostname>:<port>/assets, which a user can access only
when watt.server.displayDirectories is true and the user is logged in.
When the user opens this page without logging in, the page prompts for
credentials. However, if the user clicks Cancel, authentication is
bypassed and the assets directory becomes visible. This behavior
occurs whether the browser stores the login or not.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-102432
The pub.client.ldap:delete service returns HTTP 200 OK status code even when
the LDAP server does not find the specified DN.

This issue occurs because the service does not raise an error when the requested
DN is missing in the LDAP directory. The HTTP status reflects only the
successful 
execution of the service, not the LDAP operation outcome.

This issue is now resolved. The service introduces a new input parameter
"failIfNotFound". When you set this parameter to yes, the service returns an
error if the DN does not exist in the LDAP directory. If you do not specify the
parameter or set it to no, the service continues with the existing behavior.

PIE-102450
This fix includes webMethods Application Manager, which is a new CLI tool that
can generate 
Dockerfiles from an existing webMethods Integration project or edge runtime. For
 more information, 
see the "weMethods Application Manager CLI Reference guide" in the Integration
Server documentation. 

This fix also introduces the following enhancements to the webMethods Package
Manager CLI tool: 
- The "-v|--version" option displays the version of the wpm CLI tool in the
format 
major.minor.patch.buildNumber, along with the Integration Server build number. 
- The "wpm list" command displays a list of packages available in the IBM
webMethods Package Registry. 
For more information about how you can filter the displayed results, see the
"webMethods Package 
Manager CLI Reference" guide in the Integration Server documentation.
- The ability to include a custom HTTPS port when providing the URL for а -r,
-ws, or -wr argument. 

PIE-102517
Integration Server logs the registration-port password in plain text, 
creating a security risk.

When the Enterprise Gateway facility logger (0079) runs at TRACE level, 
the server log displays the registration-port password in clear text.

This issue is resolved. Now, the password is masked in the server log. 

PIE-102549
Integration Server exposes submitted passwords in clear text after an account
locks due to multiple failed login attempts.

When account locking is enabled, Integration Server returns passwords provided
by users in later responses, after the account locks. This behavior discloses
credentials and puts users at risk especially if they reuse the passwords.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-102753
The pub.client:smtp service sends emails with unreadable attachment filenames.

The issue occurs because the service encodes filenames before sending messages.
So, filenames that are long or have special characters look corrupt to
recipients. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-102778
Scheduled tasks intermittently remain stuck in Running state after
executing their service, preventing subsequent runs from triggering.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-103138
The com.wm.data.DataElement class has been added to the Integration Server
whitelist configuration file whitelistclasses.xml. 

PIE-103217
Integration Server uses version 1.0.2.5 of the third-party FIPS-compliant Bouncy
Castle cryptographic 
library that contains a known security vulnerability.

The issue is resolved. Integration Server now uses version 2.1.2 of the Bouncy
Castle library. 

PIE-103261
Certified container images for Integration Server (IS) and Microservices Runtime
(MSR) now use the ubi9-minimal STIG-ready image. 

With this fix, the ubi9-minimal STIG-ready image, certified by FedRAMP as a base
image, replaces the Red Hat Universal Base Image 9 Minimal (ubi9-minimal) base
image that the certified container images for IS and MSR used previously. The
ubi9-minimal STIG-ready image is an internal hardened image, created by the
FedRAMP team and published to the IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICR). The
ubi9-minimal STIG-ready image is now the base image for the IS and MSR images
that are published to the ICR registry. 

For details about the docker build commands used for IS images, see the topic
about building the docker image for an Integration Server instance in the
Integration Server documentation. 

PIE-103401
REST service invocations fail with a NullPointerException when the Accept header
specifies an 
unrecognized content type with a character set.

The issue is resolved.

PIE-96632
The Swagger 2.0 document generated for a REST API Descriptor has HTTP response
codes in the wrong order for some GET endpoints. 

The document does not maintain the ascending order of HTTP response codes
for some GET endpoints. For example, "404 Not Found"
appears after "500 Internal Server Error", which creates confusion when
reviewing API behavior and response flows.

This issue is now resolved. 

Note: This fix applies only to new services generated from the Swagger file.

PIE-97728
Changes to metering to count top-level invocations of the services
wm.prt.status:handleChangeCommand and wm.prt.dispatch:handleTransition as
transactions. 

PIE-98285
Integration Server logs the error message "Unable to find message key '162.9001'
in bundle 'com.wm.app.b2b.server.util.data.ehcache.resources.
EhcacheDataMessageBundle'" instead of the intended message 
"Critical Error: Cache <cacheName> element evicted for 
key=<key1> value type=<valuetype> {3}."

This issue occurs when the cache is evicted at server startup. Integration
Server attempts to log the cache eviction event but does not find the corresponding
message text in the EhcacheDataMessageBundle resource file. As a result, the 
server log displays the "Unable to find message key…" error instead of the 
meaningful cache eviction message.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-98650
Designer freezes during variable search (Ctrl+F) in complex pipeline documents.

Designer freezes when searching for variables in deeply nested documents with a
large number of doctypes, especially if the variable is missing or located near
the end. The search logic fails to handle large and deeply nested structures,
causing infinite traversal and UI failure. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-99000
Creating an email port through application.properties using dynamic variables
fails because Integration Server does not correctly handle the listener password
and omits the package property in listeners.cnf, leading to authentication
errors. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100200 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server throws the error "Cannot assign field 'gLoop' because 
'this.gState' is null" when you update the Enterprise Gateway external port.

Integration Server displays this error message when Enterprise Gateway Server
experiences high load.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100300 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server no longer automatically uses distributed caches for system
caches when the Integration Server belongs to a cluster. 

Previously, if an Integration Server was configured to be in a cluster,
Integration Server automatically made each system cache a distributed cache even
if Integration Server used local caches only. 

Now, when an Integration Server belongs to a cluster, Integration Server sets
system cache managers to use distributed caches if at least one system cache is
a distributed cache. If all the system caches are local caches, Integration
Server does not configure the system cache manager to use distributed caches. 

PIE-100672 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
After applying fixes that include PIE-88454 and PIE-88393, JDBC connection 
metadata for expired connections leaks from the JDBC connection pool.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100784 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
JDBC connection leak under heavy load or after a SQLException occurs.

Under heavy load, Integration Server might leak JDBC connections from a JDBC
connection pool. A connection leak can also occur when the JDBC connection
raises a SQLException while clearing warnings. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-101013 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server does not write audit logs to the console despite being
configured to do so. 

When the environment variable SAG_IS_AUDIT_STDOUT_LOGGER specifies the audit
logs to write to the console and watt.server.audit.logFilesToKeep=1, Integration
Server does not write audit logs to the console. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-101107 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
REST requests using the RAD directive fail if the Authorization header lacks
an authorization type.

Integration Server requires an authorization type in the Authorization header
and returns a 401 Unauthorized response when it is missing.

This issue is resolved. Integration Server now defaults to Basic authentication
when the Authorization header does not specify a type, preventing 401
Unauthorized responses.

PIE-101164 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-87159, the Swagger 2.0 documents that
Integration Server generates contain additional lines that impact consuming
applications. 

The following line is added for every object in the Swagger 2.0 document
generated from a REST API Descriptor: 

type: object

The additional object can change the way the REST API Descriptor is consumed by
other applications. According to the Swagger specification, the absence of the
type results in undefined behavior 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server now includes a server configuration
parameter to control whether the type:object is added for objects in Swagger 2.0
documents. 

watt.server.rest.swagger.setTypeForAllObjects
Specifies whether a Swagger 2.0 document generated for a REST API Descriptor
explicitly sets the type to object for objects. Set this parameter to false to
generate Swagger 2.0 documents in the same manner as older releases which do not
include PIE-87159. Leave this parameter blank to maintain the current behavior
which includes explicitly specifying the type of all objects. 

Changes to this parameter take effect the next time integration Server generates
a Swagger 2.0 document for the REST API Descriptors. 

The watt.server.rest.swagger.setTypeForAllObjects parameter does not impact
OpenAPI 3 documents (Swagger 3.0) generated for REST API Descriptors. 

PIE-101165 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Creating signed and encrypted S/MIME data using the 
pub.smime.keystore:createSignedAndEncryptedData service results in invalid
output. 

When using the pub.smime.keystore:createSignedAndEncryptedData service to create
signed and encrypted S/MIME messages, Integration Server generates an invalid
signed S/MIME message containing duplicate MIME headers with conflicting values.
The issue is because of the changes in header handling behavior introduced
during the transition to Bouncy Castle JARs.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-101357 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-88419, an Enterprise Gateway
configuration sometimes resolves OPTIONS preflight requests on the Internal
Server instead of the Enterprise Gateway Server. 
 
The resolution to PIE-88419 causes an Enterprise Gateway Server to forward an
OPTIONS request to the Internal Integration Server when CORS is enabled. The
Internal Integration Server then resolves the request. Prior to installing
PIE-88419, the Enterprise Gateway Server resolved an OIPTIONS request. 
 
The behavior introduced with PIE-88419 is now removed.

PIE-101493 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Changes to how Integration Server handles errors that occur while backing up the
config directory during the server initialization process. 

During server initialization, Integration Server attempts to back up the
<IntegrationServer>/instances/<instanceName>/config directory. If an attempt to
back up a file or directory within the config directory fails, Integration
Server does not back up any more items and continues with server initialization.
However, insufficient file permissions or unexpected errors that occur while
backing up the config directory might cause Integration Server to become
unresponsive and prevent server initialization. 

To improve the server initialization process, if an error occurs while backing
up a specific file or directory, Integration Server now logs the exception and
the process of backing up the config directory continues. 

PIE-101672 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server now provides wm.broker.util:changeBrokerTriggerState to 
enable or disable broker triggers.

PIE-101907 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server appears to be unresponsive, but ports are active and
listening for requests. 

Threads generating UUIDs stalled, creating thread contention which prevented
Integration Server from processing new requests. Integration Server appeared to
become unresponsive despite having active ports. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-102285
You can now print out the Integration Server logs only to the console to free
storage space on the file system. 

When you start Integration Server from the command prompt, use the "-log none
-logformat json" switch to print out the log entries from the following logs
only to the console in the JSON format: 

audit log files, such as WMERROR, WMSERVICE
server.log

If you use just the "-log none" switch, the server log entries are printed out
to the console, but the audit log entries are sent to the console and saved as
log files on the file system. 

To reduce the length of messages printed to the console, you can use the
watt.server.log.shortKey parameter to shorten the key names in the
JSON-formatted log messages.

PIE-102358
Updates to Integration Server to provide a list of values for server
configuration parameters and environment variables to webMethods Integration
(SaaS). 

PIE-102594
Integration Server now supports JWT signature verification using public keys
retrieved from a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint.

Configure a JWKS endpoint for each trusted issuer, and Integration Server
automatically downloads and refreshes the issuer’s public keys for signature
verification.

This enhancement eliminates the need to manually update the truststore when
issuers rotate their keys. 
For more information, see the webMethods Integration Server Administrator's
Guide. 

PIE-102695
When using the getConnection() method to get a connection from a JDBC connection 
pool, the method returns the connection that is currently in use and is not 
released back to the pool yet.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-98736 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server throws a compilation error while compiling Java services in
a package when the Java compiler version differs from the Java version of the
JVM running Integration Server.

If the watt.server.compile parameter points to an external Java compiler that
uses a different Java version than the JVM running Integration Server, the
mismatch causes the compilation to fail.

This issue is now resolved. The watt.server.compile parameter now uses the
Java compiler from the JDK bundled with Integration Server as the default value.

PIE-99207 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server provides a new public service, 
pub.utils.messaging:listOutOfSyncProtobufDocs. This service compares protocol 
buffers between Integration Server and Universal Messaging for publishable documents.
The service accepts the following input parameters:

packageNames (String List, Optional): List of package names. The service scans 
documents within these packages to compare IS and UM protobuf descriptors.

documentTypeNames (String List, Optional): List of document type names. The 
service limits the comparison to these specified document type names.

decompile (String, Optional): Specifies whether the service generates reverse 
.proto files from compiled binaries. If true, generates reverse .proto files 
from compiled binaries. The default value is false.

protoFileLocation (String, Conditional): Specifies the location to store .proto 
files. Required only if decompile is true. If the path does not exist, 
Integration Server attempts to create the folder structure. If the server fails 
to create the folder, it throws an error.

All input parameters are optional. If you do not provide any input values, the
service compares all publishable documents on the server and generates a report, 
which can be resource-intensive based on the number of documents and packages.

Output Parameter:

outOfSync (Document List): A list of documents where IS and UM protobuf 
descriptors are not in sync. Each entry includes:

package (String): Name of the package containing the document.

documentName (String): Name of the document type.

channelName (String): Associated channel name.

protoFileName (String): Name of the .proto file (if applicable).

error (String): Description of the mismatch or error encountered.

The output signature remains same whether you provide the input parameters or 
not. The service displays these results as part of its output.

Usage Notes:

- If decompile is true and protoFileLocation is missing, the service returns an 
  error.

- Protocol buffers are supported only for Universal Messaging. This service 
  works only for documents synced with UM.

PIE-99556 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix24)
Integration Server throws the “Unable to locate or start compiler” error
when you save a Java service in Designer.

To compile a Java service, Integration Server runs the javac command based on
the value of the "watt.server.compile" parameter, which defaults to
"javac -classpath {0} -d {1} {2}". When the server’s classpath includes multiple
JAR files, the length of the resulting command exceeds the Windows command line
limit of 32,000 characters. Therefore, Integration Server fails to run the
command. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server passes compiler arguments
through a temporary file instead of directly on the command line. To compile a 
Java service, Integration Server creates a temporary file with the required 
arguments, runs the command using the "javac @<tempfile>" syntax, and deletes 
the file after execution (regardless of whether the command is successful or not). |
This method avoids the Windows character limit and ensures that Java services 
compile successfully.

PIE-100450 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
The Searchable checkbox does not appear on the Edit cache page for the TnDocType
system cache. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100512 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
The watt.server.oauth.authCode.expirySeconds parameter cannot be set to -1.

When watt.server.oauth.authCode.expirySeconds is set to -1, authorization codes
never expire. However, validation logic prevented setting the value to -1. 

This issue is now resolved. The validation logic for
watt.server.oauth.authCode.expirySeconds now allows the value to be -1 or a
positive integer greater than or equal to 60. 

When watt.server.oauth.authCode.expirySeconds is set to -1, the Remove Expired
Tokens system task is removed. 

PIE-100552 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
The diagnostic archive generated by the diagnostic utility now includes the JPS
module configuration settings for the JVM. 

The config/JavaModules.txt file in the diagnostic archive contains JPS module
configuration. This information can help diagnose runtime Java permission errors
caused by failed attempts to invoke Java code protected by this module. 

PIE-100577 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Integration Server fails to log the packages it loads during startup, which
makes debugging difficult.

Integration Server does not log the packages it loads at startup, which makes it
hard to trace loaded packages and debug when packages exist on the disk but
fail to load.

This issue is now resolved. The server logs packages loaded at startup,
improving traceability and debugging.

PIE-100583 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
ACL checking does not work for members of an LDAP group that was created using a
configuration variables template (application.properties file). 

If an LDAP group was created by applying a configuration variables template, ACL
checking for members of the group is successful only when the groupName portion
of the ldapgroup.<groupName>.dn key is the same as the group name in the
distinguished name. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100657 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-100670 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
The pub.client:soapClient service does not consistently enforce the timeout set
on the INVOKE step. 

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server enforces the timeout setting for
the INVOKE step. 

This resolution also corrects an issue where a SOAP call from API Gateway did
not have a timeout value. 

PIE-100684 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Integration Server Administrator does not show the alert message “Restart is
required for changes to take effect” immediately after saving extended settings.
The message appears only after the user manually refreshes the browser, which
confuses administrators. 

Integration Server Administrator does not refresh the masthead when extended
settings are updated. As a result, the restart notification remains hidden until
the page reloads. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100798 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
After switching from Entrust to Bouncy Castle libraries, processing SMIME
messages with pub.smime.keystore:processEncryptedData throws “Could not retrieve 
content from input” for some inputs.

The decryption failures result from differences in how Bouncy Castle library
parses encrypted SMIME data.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100897 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Support for a 16 byte salt for password encryption.

Integration Server can now use a 16 byte salt for password encryption. Set the
new server configuration parameter watt.server.auth.password.saltLength to 16 to
use a 16 byte salt. Set the parameter to 8 to use an 8 byte salt. The default
value is 8. 

Integration Server must be restarted for changes to take effect.

After the watt.server.auth.password.saltLength parameter value is changed,
Integration Server uses the new value for encrypting new passwords. Existing
passwords that use the previous salt length continue to work. 

PIE-100988 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
PGP encryption fails when the pub.security:encrypt service selects an expired
key from the keyring as the first key for encryption. The service throws an
exception even though the keyring contains another valid key.

The failure occurs because the updated Bouncy Castle libraries in
Integration Server change the key selection behavior.

This issue is resolved. The service now uses the first valid non-expired public
key for encryption.

When an Integration Server is configured as an Internal Server for an Enterprise
Gateway, the Internal Server might throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when
reading the response to an authentication request and the response does not
contain any data. 

Now, an Internal Server no longer throws a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when
the response does not contain any data. 

PIE-80907 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
The pub.client.ldap:search service enters an infinite loop when run with 
pageSize. 

Integration Server uses the ldapCookie returned by the LDAP server while 
performing paged searches using pub.client.ldap:search. The LDAP 
server must return null when there are no entries to return to Integration
Server. However, pub.client.ldap:search does not receive null and enters an
infinite loop when run with pageSize. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-95728 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Integration Server throws detailed error messages whenever it fails to enable or

PIE-97062 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
In a stateless cluster, an OAuth client or scope that was created, updated, or
deleted on one server might not be reflected on another server in the cluster. 

Integration Server fetches client and scope information from a local cache. In a
stateless cluster, OAuth client and scope information is stored in a database.
At startup, each Integration Server in a stateless cluster synchronizes the
local caches with the database to obtain the latest updates.  If an Integration
Server has not recently reloaded the local caches, changes made to OAuth clients
and scopes by other Integration Servers in the cluster are not available in the
local cache. 

Integration Server now reloads the local client cache and scope cache after
creating, updating, or deleting a client or scope. This reduces the window for
which the local cache information is out of sync with the database. 

PIE-97787 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)

PIE-98170 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Integration Server restricts the value of
watt.server.http.Content-Security-Policy to script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline',
which limits administrators from using other valid Content-Security-Policy
values.

This issue is now resolved by updating the behavior of the parameter. The
parameter now accepts any valid Content-Security-Policy value.

Note: The Integration Server Administrator includes pages that are built by
using different technologies. Some pages display correctly only with
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'. If you use a different value and the pages
do not work as expected, you can reset the parameter.
For more information about watt.server.http.Content-Security-Policy, see IBM

PIE-99150 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Integration Server sanitizes and returns user-supplied data in the response
when the Integration Server Administrator invokes the login service with invalid

This issue is now resolved. The service no longer returns any part of the input
and logs the sanitized data in the server and security logs.

PIE-99189 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Changes to the pub.utils:deepClone service to prevent the deserialization of
unsafe Java objects. 

The pub.utils:deepClone service performs a deep clone of an object using the
default Java serialization mechanism. For standard Java objects, such as a
String, Double, and [] (array), the service now performs a deep clone if the
Java object is serializable. For custom Java objects, the service can now use a
whitelist filter to prevent the deserialization of unsafe Java objects. The
service only clones the object if the class appears in the whitelist. 

The pub.utils:deepClone service performs whitelist filtering when the
watt.server.checkWhitelist parameter is set to true. 

PIE-99473 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Integration Server now caches cryptographic hashed passwords which might improve

PIE-99601 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
Integration Server returns header parameter values and omits body parameters
for a REST API POST request.

In REST API POST requests, Integration Server gives precedence to header

Integration Server includes only the header values in the response and
ignores the corresponding body parameters.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-99848 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix23)
The pub.string:messageFormat service does not handle single quotes correctly.

This fix resolves two issues surrounding the use of single quotes in the pattern 
string for pub.string:messageFormat.

- When a literal single quote appears in a pattern string, the 
pub.string:messageFormat service removed the single quote which resulted in 
missing characters in the output. Now, during service execution, the 
pub.string:messageFormat service replaces a single quote between two letters in 
a pattern string with two single quotes as part of processing. This ensures that 
the output contains the single quote.

Note: The pub.string:messageFormat service does not replace two single quotes 
between two letters with four single quotes.

- When single quotes are used with a placeholder in a pattern, the 
pub.string:messageFormat service does not replace the placeholder. The 
pub.string:messageFormat now handles single quotes with placeholders correctly.

Note: To ensure the correct output when using single quotes in placeholder 
patterns, format the patterns according to the Java.Text.MessageFormat syntax.

PIE-98917 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix22)
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in
pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service. 
 
The resourceUri input parameter for the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service
points to the resource that the client application wants to access on the
resource server. The service accepts any URI which results in Integration Server
attempting to access the URI. This is an SSRF vulnerability 
 
To resolve this vulnerability, Integration Server now uses an allow list with
the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service. If the URI does not appear in the
allow list, the service ends with a ServiceException. 
 
Integration Server introduces two server configuration parameters for enabling
and specifying the allow list for pub.client.oauth:executeRequest. 
 
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled
Specifies whether Integration Server uses an allow list with the
pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service. Set this parameter to true to use the
allow list defined by the watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers parameter.
Set this parameter false if you do not want to use an allow list. A value of
false leaves the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service vulnerable to a
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).  The default value is true. 
 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers
Specifies the URIs that can be accessed by the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest
service. When an allow list is used with the service, the value of the
resourceUri input parameter must appear in the list for Integration Server to
attempt to access the URI. If the URI is not in the allow list, the service ends
with a ServiceException that states “<resourceName> resource cannot be accessed.
The resource is not on the allow list.” 

The watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled must be set to true for the allow list
to be enforced. 
 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

You can set this parameter to a comma- or space-separated list of URIs or the
absolute path to a file. You cannot specify a combination of these. 

To define this parameter using a comma- or space- separated list of URIs, enter
protocol://hostname or protocol://hostname:portnumber. You can specify the IP
address or the name of the machine for hostname. The values are case-sensitive.
Use a space or comma delimiter to specify multiple values. 

To define this parameter using a text file set the value to:
file:pathToFile\filename

For example:
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers=file:c:\oauth\allowedUriList.txt 

The file must use the same syntax as is required for the
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers with the difference that each line
must be an allowed URI or a regular expression. 

Note: The IP address and host name cannot be used interchangeably. For example,
if you specify a host name, and the resourceUri uses the corresponding IP
address, the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service ends with an error. 

You can use an asterisk (*) to indicate that any URI is allowed.

You can also use regular expressions in the comma-separated list of allowed URIs
which can make the list of URIs easier to maintain. Integration Server treats
any value in the comma-separated list that begins with "r:" as a regular
expression. Integration Server treats any value that does not begin with "r:" as
a simple string. The server configuration parameter uses the Java regular
expression syntax, as documented at Pattern (Java Platform SE 7 ) . 

A regular expression value must match the entire value of the supplied
resourceUri value for it to be considered a match. 

Example:

watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers=http://test1.domain.com,r:https?://.*.test2.domain.com:[0-9]+,r:.+\.[a-zA-Z]*-int.domain.com

Integration Server treats the first value, http://test1.domain.com, as a simple
string. If a resourceUri is set to this value, the
pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service attempts to access the URI. 

The second value, "r:https?://.*.test2.domain.com:[0-9]+", contains a regular
expression. The "r:" is not part of the regular expression. The actual regular
expression used to match the supplied resourceUri is
"https?://.*.test2.domain.com:[0-9]+". 

The third value, "r:.+\.[a-zA-Z]*-int.domain.com", contains a regular
expression. The "r:" is not part of the regular expression. The actual regular
expression used to match the supplied resourceUri is
".+\.[a-zA-Z]*-int.domain.com". 

resourceUri: http://test1.domain.com will be accessed because it is equal to the
first value. 
resourceUri: http://my.test2.domain.com:8080 will be accessed because it matches
the second value. 
resourceUri: https://my.test2.domain.com:8088 will be accessed because it
matches the second value. 
resourceURI: http://my.test2.domain.com will not be accessed. If it had a port
number, it would match the second value. 
resourceUri: nbps://example.prod-int.domain.com will be accessed because it
matches the third value. 
resourceUri: example.qa.staging-int.domain.com" will be accessed because it
matches the third value. 
resourceUri: example.dev1-int.domain.com" will not be accessed. If the second
token of the host name did not include any digits, it would have matched the
third value. 

Regular expressions that match any host name, IP address and port (e.g. "r:.+"
and "r:.*") will have the same effect as "*". 

Note: When an allow list is enabled for pub.client.oauth:executeRequest,
Integration Server evaluates the list of regular expressions in
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers sequentially for every request.
Integration Server performs a regular expression match operation on each regular
expression until a match is found or all regular expressions in the list have
been evaluated. Place the more frequently matched regular expressions at the
beginning of the comma-separated list. 

Note: If the watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled parameter is set to true and
you do not specify a value for watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers, all
calls to pub.client.oauth:executeRequest end with an error. 

Important!  If your solution uses the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service,
after applying a fix that includes PIE-98917 you must take one of the following
actions: 
- Disable the use of an allow list with pub.client.oauth:executeRequest by
setting watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled to false. 
- Specify a list of allowed URIs in the
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers parameter.

PIE-99717 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix22)
PATCH requests lose their request bodies when redirected with 307 or 308
responses. 

Integration Server does not preserve request bodies for the PATCH method during
307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) responses. As a result, it
sends redirected requests without the original payload, leading to incomplete or
invalid updates on the target endpoint. This behavior causes integration failures,
data inconsistencies, and unexpected errors—particularly in environments with
frequent redirects where the redirected endpoint depends on the PATCH request
body. 

This issue is now resolved. Redirect handling is enhanced to ensure that
PATCH requests retain and forward their original request body when the HTTP
client request includes a valid the Location header, the followRedirect
parameter is enabled, and the response status code is 307 or 308. This ensures 
reliable and standards-compliant redirect behavior.

PIE-97669 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix21)
Integration Server does not decode the password provided by the JDBC pool
configuration properly. 

If the password for JDBC pool configuration is provided directly rather than

incorrectly. As a result, when the password is supplied to the JDBC pool, the
password is incorrect and might include invalid characters. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-97764 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix21)
Integration Server accepts HTTP requests with invalid or empty Host headers
without validation, creating potential vulnerabilities.
 
Integration Server does not validate the incoming HTTP requests and responds
with the 200 OK status code even when the Host header is missing or invalid,
allowing arbitrary host values and exposing the server to security risks.
 
This issue is now resolved by introducing a new server configuration parameter,
watt.server.security.allowedHostHeaders.
 
watt.server.security.allowedHostHeaders:
Specifies a comma-separated list of valid Host header values that Integration
Server accepts for incoming HTTP requests. When you set the
parameter, Integration Server validates the Host header in incoming requests
and returns an "Invalid Host Header" message if the value is not included in
the list or the Host header is left empty. The parameter also supports the
wildcard character asterisk (*) for pattern matching.
For example, watt.server.security.allowedHostHeaders=*.example.com:5555
allows 123.example.com:5555 and abc.example.com:5555 but rejects 
example.com:5555. If you do not set this parameter, Integration Server 
continues to accept all values without validation.
Note: If you set an incorrect hostname or omit the port of the 
Integration Server instance in the parameter value, you may get locked out of 
Integration Server Administrator with an Invalid Host Header error. To avoid 
getting locked out, always include the hostname and port of the 
Integration Server instance in the parameter. If you get locked out, access 
Integration Server Administrator using the server IP and port, then update the 
parameter with the correct values.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect.

Alpine. 

Integration Server images use Red Hat Universal Base Image 9 Minimal
(ubi9-minimal). 

Microservices Runtime images are provided with ubi9-minimal or the standard
Alpine with a musl JDK, such as azul/zulu-openjdk-alpine:17-latest. 

PIE-98083 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix21)
Thread dump log utility generates more thread dumps than permitted by the
configuration. 

When enabled, the thread dump log utility should generate a set of 3 logs at 10
minute intervals. However, the utility generates logs more frequently, resulting
in the server appearing to be unavailable. 

This fix resolve the thread safety issue in the utility that caused the
generation of excess logs.

document incorrectly assigns all response codes the same schema as HTTP 200,
instead of their own defined schemas.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-98219 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix21)
Creating signed S/MIME data using the pub.smime.keystore:createSignedData
service results in invalid output.

When using the pub.smime.keystore:createSignedData service to create signed
S/MIME messages, Integration Server generates an invalid signed S/MIME message
containing duplicate MIME headers with conflicting values. The issue is because
of the changes in header handling behavior introduced during the transition to
Bouncy Castle JARs.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-98290 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix21)
Enhancements to statistics data collection.

Integration Server introduces the following changes to provide more control of 
collection of purging and data by the Statistics Data Collector.

- A configuration parameter to disable persistence of time-series data.
The Statistics Data Collector can be configured to capture data statistics for 
time-series data but not save that data to a database. A call to the /metrics 
endpoint returns time-series data for the current time period. However, the 
Dashboard does not display time-series data for the JVM metrics, Usages, 
Services, or APIs tabs.
Use the watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.includeTimeSeriesData server 
configuration parameter to control whether the Statistics Data Collector persists 
time-series data. Set watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.includeTimeSeriesData 
to true to collect and persist time-series data. Set the parameter to false to 
collect but not time persist time-series data. Integration Server does not need 
to be restarted for changes to this parameter to take effect. The default value 
is true.

- A configuration parameter to control the frequency with which the Statistics 
Data Collector deletes old data.
The Statistics Data Collector deletes old data in batches using a scheduled 
system task that runs every 4 hours. (Note this is a JVM system task, not an 
Integration Server system task). For every scheduled delete task, Statistics 
Data Collector deletes the batches of data collected over a 4 hour period 
starting with the oldest data. The delete task performs batch deletions every 
30 seconds until all data older than the retention date is removed. The 
retention date is controlled by the retentionDays parameter. Prior to this fix, 
the frequency of the system task could not be changed. Now, Integration Server 
includes server configuration parameters to control the frequency with which the 
Statistics Data Collector purges data and the amount of data purged in each deletion.

watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.removal.interval specifies the number of 
hours between each purge of data by the Statistics Data Collector. Set this 
parameter to a value greater than or equal to 0. The default is 4 hours. If the 
parameter is set to 0, the Statistics Data Collector does not manage the removal 
of data. The user must manage deletion of statistics data.

Integration Server must be restarted for changes to this parameter to take effect.

Note: The watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.includeTimeSeriesData value does 
not impact whether the Statistics Data Collector deletes old data. If you disable 
persistence of time-series data, the Statics Data Collector still removes stale 
data with a JVM system task. This behavior allows the purge to run without 
collecting any additional data.

watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.removal.rows specifies a time interval that 
determines the number of rows that each purge removes from the database. To 
reduce pressure on the database server, the Statistics Data Collector removes 
stale data for the specified segment of time. For example, a value of 15m 
indicates that each deleted batch encompasses data collected in a 15 minute time 
period. Specify 1 to 3 integers followed by the letters h, H, m, M to indicate 
whether the unit of time is in minutes or hours. The default is 4 hours. If you 
do not include a unit of time, the Statistics Data Colector ignore the provided 
value and uses the default of 4 hours.

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter 
to take effect.

- An internal service to provide more information about the Statistics Data 
Collector, including values of server configuration parameters. Use the following 
URL to obtain status information: <http://host:port>/invoke/wm.server.datacollector:status

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-98311 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix20)
The pub.client:http service ignores the configured flow timeout for a POST
request with a large payload using chunked transfer encoding.

When a REST API uses the pub.client:http service to send a large payload in a
POST request in chunks, the configured flow timeout is not honored. This issue
occurs because sending the payload in chunks causes the request to take longer
time to complete. During this process, the flow timeout is not enforced as
expected. Consequently, the request continues beyond the configured limit and
eventually fails with an HTTP 500 error after a significant delay.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-95103 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix19)
Support for using environment variables or a new custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file to 
add classes or libraries to the beginning or end of the Microservices Runtime 
classpath instead of modifying setenv.(bat,sh) .
 
Previously, to add classes or libraries to the beginning or end of the server 
classpath for Microservices Runtime, users needed to add the full path in the 
Java system properties PREPENDCLASSES or APPENDCLASSES in the 
<Integration Server_directory>/bin/setenv.(bat,sh) file. Similarly, users needed 
to set the Java system property PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH to add classes or 
libraries to the beginning of the Java classpath and set APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH 
to add classes or libraries to the end of the Java classpath. Further, the 
setenv.(bat,sh) file can be overwritten as part of applying a fix to Integration 
Server. As a result, the configuration requirement to update sentenv.(bat,sh) is 
inflexible and may be difficult to maintain in a containerized environment.
 
To address this issue, Microservices Runtime introduces the following changes 
for adding classes and libraries to the server or system classpath:
• A custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file which supports additions to the classpath through 
the PREPENDCLASSES, APPENDCLASSES, PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH, APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH 
properties in the file.
• Environment variables that can be supplied during Microservices Runtime startup 
to specify additions to the classpath: ENV_PREPENDCLASSES, ENV_APPENDCLASSES, 
ENV_PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH, and ENV_APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH.
 
After applying this fix, take the following steps to add classes and libraries 
can be added to the server classpath and the Java classpath:
1. If you previously specified values for one or more of the following properties 
   in setenv.(bat,sh) file, use a text editor to remove the parameters from the 
   file: PREPENDCLASSES, APPENDCLASSES, PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH, APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH
2. To add classes or libraries to the server or Java classpath using the 
   custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file, use a text editor to open 
   <Integration Server_directory>{}/bin/ custom_setenv.(bat,sh) and set one or 
   more of the following parameters and then save the file:
   PREPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the beginning of the server 
   classpath for Microservices Runtime
   APPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the end of the server classpath 
   for Microservices Runtime
   PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the beginning of 
   the Java classpath for Microservices Runtime
   APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the end of the Java 
   classpath for Microservices Runtime
3. To add classes or libraries to the server or Java classpath by supplying 
   environment variables, set one or more of the following environment variables 
   when starting Microservice Runtime:
   ENV_PREPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the beginning of the server 
   classpath for Microservices Runtime
   ENV_APPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the end of the server 
   classpath for Microservices Runtime
   ENV_PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the beginning 
   of the Java classpath for Microservices Runtime
   ENV_APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the end of the 
   Java classpath for Microservices Runtime

Note: If a value is set for a property in custom_setenv.(bat,sh) and for the 
corresponding environment variable, the environment variable takes precedence.

Important! After applying a fix that includes PIE-95103 and moving 
PREPENDCLASSES, APPENDCLASSES, PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH, APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH 
from setenv.(bat,sh) to custom_setenv.(bat,sh), do not edit setenv.(bat,sh).

Support for using the acr_values parameter in an authorization request sent to 
the Open ID Provider from Integration Server.

When sending an authorization request to an Open ID Provider, Integration Sever 
includes acr_values parameter which specifies acr (Authentication Context Class 
Reference) values set in the OpenID JSON configuration file. Integration Server 
sets values for the acr_values request parameter using the following logic:

- If the OpenID configuration file includes the acr_values and 
acr_values_supported parameters, Integration Server validates the contents of 
acr_values against the acr_values_supported. Integration Server adds only the 
acr values that appear in the acr_values_supported to the acr_values parameter 
in the authorization request.

- If the OpenID configuration file includes acr_values only, Integration Server 
adds the acr values to the acr_values parameter in the authorization request.

 The configuration file is at the following location: 
 <IntegrationServer>\instances\<instanceName>\config\security\openid

This issue is now resolved by adding a timeout parameter to the service.
When the timeout parameter is set, Integration Server uses Java regular

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-96648 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix19)
The pub.client:http service ignores the flow timeout when it fails to establish

When a flow service uses an Invoke step to call the pub.client:http service but 
fails to establish a connection, the service waits for the full connection 
timeout to expire before retrying, ignoring the flow timeout. The service should 
consider both the flow timeout and connection timeout and adjust connection 
retries accordingly. However, the service fails to adjust the connection timeout 
or retries based on the flow timeout, causing inconsistencies.

This issue is now resolved. Now, the service honors the flow timeout.

New option to prevent using credentials for a confidential OAuth client to

When registering an OAuth client of type confidential, Integration Server 
creates a user account and shares a client secret for the account with the 
administrator who registered the client. The client secret and client ID are the 
credentials the confidential client needs to complete activities such as 
requesting an access token and refreshing an access token. However, by default, 
Integration Server does not restrict the client from using the credentials to 
invoke other services.
 
Integration Server now provides a server configuration parameter that you can 
use to restrict the use of client ID and client secret to services handling OAuth 
requests only.
 
watt.server.oauth.restrictCredentials
Specifies whether Integration Server restricts the use of credentials for a 
confidential OAuth client to services that handle OAuth requests only. When set 
to false, the client ID and client secret for a registered confidential client 
can be used to invoke any service on Integration Server. When set to true, 
attempts to use the credentials for a confidential client to invoke a service 
that does not handle OAuth processing results in a rejection of the request. The 
default is false.
 
You do not need to restart Integration server for changes to this parameter to

In the SAML single sign-on process, Integration Server acts as the service 
provider and sends a SAML request to the Identity Provider (IdP). The IdP 
authenticates the user and sends a SAML response to Integration Server. 
Integration Server validates the signature of the SAML response and then logs 
identified user into Integration Server Administrator. 

After applying this fix, you must complete the following tasks to configure 
SAML-based SSO for Integration Server Administrator:

Complete the following prerequisites:

- Configure an identity provider (IdP) for use with Integration Server. 
  Activities include creating a profile for Integration Server in the IdP and 
  creating a client ID for the profile. 

- Work with the IdP administrator to configure signing and encryption keys for 
  the SAML response.

To configure SAML-based SSO for Integration Server Administrator: 

1. Create a new configuration file named samlsso.cnf with the entries provided 
   in the section “samlsso.cnf configuration file”, below. 

   Replace the sample values with values specific to your environment.  

2. Save the samlsso.cnf file in the following location:
   <webm_install_dir>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instance-name>/config/security/saml 

3 Restart Integration Server.

4. Using Integration Server Administrator, define a trusted SAML issuer for the IdP.
   Navigate to the Security > SAML page and click Add SAML Token Issuer.
   Supply the following information:   

   - Issuer Name: the idpURL value in the samlsso.cnf configuration file.

   - Truststore Alias: Alias to the truststore that contains the public keys of 
     the SAML token issuer.

   - Certificate Alias: The alias within the truststore that contains the public 
     key of the SAML token issuer. Integration Server uses this certificate 
	 associated with this key to verify the signature of the SAML Response 
	 returned by the IdP.


samlsso.cnf configuration file
The samlsso.cnf configuration file contains the configuration that Integration 
Server needs to send SAML requests and handle SAML assertions in responses. The 
samlsso.cnf file must contain the following entries with the sample value 
replaced by values specific to your environment:

samlsso.enabled=true
samlsso.idpUrl=http://idpHost:8080/realms/samlsso/protocol/saml
samlsso.acsUrl=http://IShost:5555/WmAdmin?samlsso=true
samlsso.issuerId=http://IShost:5555/WmAdmin?samlsso=true
samlsso.signRequest=true
samlsso.keystoreAlias=is_keystore
samlsso.signatureKeyAlias=keycloak
samlsso.encryptionKeyAlias=keycloak
samlsso.groupAttribute=Groups
samlsso.groupMappings.1.from=admins
samlsso.groupMappings.1.to=Administrators,Developers,ReadOnlyAdministrators
samlsso.groupMappings.2.from=everyone
samlsso.groupMappings.2.to=Everybody

enabled - true|false. Whether SAML-based SSO is in use for this Integration Server.
          Must be set to true for SAML-based SSO to work. 

idpURL - URL to which Integration Server sends the SAML request for authentication.

acsURL - URL of the assertion consumer, which is Integration Server.
         The identity provider (IdP) redirects to this URL with the SAML response.
         Replace ISHost with the host name or IP addresses of Integration Server.
         Replace 5555 with a secure port on Integration Server. 

issuerId - Client ID of the profile defined for Integration Server in the IdP. 

signRequest - true|false. Whether to sign the SAML request that Integration Server 
              sends to the IdP.
              Set to true if the IdP accepts signed SAML requests. 

keystoreAlias - Integration Server keystore alias that contains the certificates 
                for signing
                SAML requests and decrypting the SAML response returned from the 
				IdP.

signatureKeyAlias - Key alias for the certificate to use for signing the SAML 
                    request.

encryptionKeyAlias - Key alias for the certificate to use for decrypting a SAML 
                     response from the IdP. 

groupAttribute - Name of the IdP attribute that contains the group membership of 
                 the user. Integration Server scans the SAML assertion and looks 
				 for a SAML Attribute by this name. Integration Server uses the 
				 values for performing mappings from IdP groups to Integration 
				 Server groups. 

groupMappings - An array to map IdP groups to Integration Server groups.
                For example, the first one shows that, if the value of 
				groupAttribute contains "admins", it is mapped to the Integration 
				Server group named Administrators, Developers, and 
				ReadOnlyAdministrators. Because the Administrators group is part 
				of Administrators ACL, this user will be able to log into 
				Integration Server Administrator.


For each IdP group that needs to be mapped to one or more groups in Integration 
Server, create a pair of group mapping entries that start with the format 
samlsso.groupMappings.# where # is a number. One member of the pair must include 
“from” in the entry name and the other member must include “to”. For example:

samlsso.groupMappings.1.from
samlsso.groupMappings.1.to

Use the samlsso.groupMappings.#.from entry to specify the IdP group that you to 
map to the Integration Server user groups in the samlsso.groupMappings.#.to entry. 

For example, the entries below establish group mapping 1 in which a user that 
belongs to the IdP group named admins will be a member of the Integration Server 
groups Administrators, Developers and ReadOnlyAdministrators.

samlsso.groupMappings.1.from=admins
samlsso.groupMappings.1.to=Administrators,Developers,ReadOnlyAdministrators

The entries below establish group mapping 2 in which a user that belongs to IdP 
group "everyone" will be a member of the "Everybody" user group in Integration 
Server.

samlsso.groupMappings.2.from=everyone
samlsso.groupMappings.2.to=Everybody

For SAML-based SSO for Integration Server Administrator to work, Administrators 
must be one of the groups listed for “to”.
The membership of the user in the Integration Server user group is temporary and 
does not persist across server restarts. 

When processing the SAML-based SSO assertion, Integration Server first checks to 
see if the user identified in the NameID of the SAML assertion exists on 
Integration Server. Integration Server searches users defined locally and then 
users defined external (LDAP or Central Users). If the user exists, Integration 
Server ignores the groupAttribute and groupMappings entries.
If the user does not exist, Integration Server creates a temporary user with a 
name that matches the NameID from the assertion. Integration Server then extracts 
the groupAttribute value to map the user to groups as defined in the groupMappings 
entry in the configuration file.

Temporary users remain in Integration Server memory until Integration Server 
shuts down.

After configuring SSO, a user can log into Integration Server Administrator by 
clicking “Log in with single sign on” on the https://<host>:<port> login page.

PIE-95838 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix19)
Option to roll back the pipeline when a TRY step ends with failure.

When a TRY step ends with failure, Integration Server does not roll back the 
pipeline to the state that existed immediately prior to TRY step execution. 
Instead, the pipeline contains any changes made by the TRY step. Legacy try-catch 
behavior built using SEQUENCE steps does result in rollback of the pipeline if the 
SEQUENCE step ends with failure.

To resolve the behavior inconsistency between the TRY steps and the legacy 
try-catch behavior provided via SEQEUNCE, Integration Server now includes a 
server configuration parameter that can be set to determine if Integration Server 
rolls back the pipeline when an error occurs during the TRY step.

watt.server.flow.tryStep.restorePipelineOnError

Specifies whether Integration Server rolls back the pipeline when an error that 
occurs during execution of a TRY step results in failure of the TRY step. When 
set to true, if an error occurs within the TRY step that causes the TRY step to 
end in failure, Integration Server rolls back the pipeline to the state prior to 
TRY step execution. When set to false, Integration Server does not roll back the 
pipeline if an error results in failure of the TRY step. The default value is false.

Integration Server needs to be restarted for changes to the parameter to take 
effect.

Note: Rollback operations are performed on the ﬁrst level of the pipeline only. 
That is, ﬁrst-level variables are restored to their original values before the 
step failed, but Integration Server does not roll back changes to any documents 
to which the ﬁrst-level variables refer.

PIE-95481 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix18)
Option to include or exclude null values in OpenAPI responses.

After applying a fix that includes PIE-92557, Integration Server handles fields
with null values in a REST response differently. Prior to application of a fix 
that includes PIE-92557, Integration Server omits fields with null values in an 
OpenAPI response instead of returning them explicitly. PIE-92557 changed the 
behavior to always include null fields in the response. However, this resulted
in unexpected and unwanted behavior in some existing implementations.

To resolve this issue, the existing watt.server.rest.includeNullFieldsInResponse
server configuration parameter now controls whether an OpenAPI response 
includes null values. Set the parameter to true to include empty fields with 
null values in the REST response. Set to false to omit empty fields from 
the REST response.

Integration Server ignores the timeout property for the Invoke flow step
during an HTTP client call.

When a flow service has an Invoke step to call the pub.client:http service and
the timeout property is configured for the step, Integration Server ignores the
timeout period while waiting for the pub.client:http service to complete. This
issue occurs for the following reasons: 
- A regression introduced in the resolution for the defect PIE-65495.
- The server relies on the read timeout instead of the INVOKE timeout when
reading the response from pub.client:http, which leads to failure in the case of
a slow stream. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-95691 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix18)
Service ends with java.util.ConcurrentModificationException.

When a service completes, Integration Server executes cleanup logic for all of
the resources used by that service. An internal class manages the list of
resources and, upon service completion, a thread iterates through the list and
closes the resources one by one. If another thread accesses the list at the same
time, Integration Server throws a  java.util.ConcurrentModificationException. 

The clean-up logic is now thread-safe, ensuring that only one thread at a time
can access the resource list.

Outbound SSL handshake is very slow and Integration Serve appears unresponsive.

When Integration Server is configured to reuse SSL sessions for outbound
requests (watt.security.ssl.resumeClientSessions=true), thread contention issues
cause the outbound SSL handshake to be very slow when there are multiple
concurrent outbound requests.  The thread contention resulted in an increase in
threads being blocked and Integration Server appeared to be unresponsive. 

This fix removes the cause of the thread contention, resulting in performance
improvements when there are multiple outbound SSL requests. 

PIE-96247 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix18)
CATCH step does not catch the RuntimeException thrown by a flow service for the
"Transformers cannot loop over list elements" error. 

If a flow service contains a MAP step in which an incorrectly configured
transformer causes Integration Server to throw a "Transformers cannot loop
over list elements" error, Integration Server surfaces the error as a
RuntimeException. However, Integration Server should indicate that the error is
a FlowException as this error cannot be caught by a CATCH step. When a
FlowException occurs, Integration Server terminates the entire flow service
immediately. If the FlowException occurs in a TRY step, the following CATCH step
cannot catch the FlowException. This is by design. 

Integration Server now clarifies that the "Transformers cannot loop over list
elements" error is a FlowException wrapped in a RuntimeException. 

Prior to this fix, Integration Server produces the following error:

java.lang.RuntimeException: [ISC.0049.9027] Error at
pub.list:appendToDocumentList - Transformers cannot loop over list elements 

After this fix, Integration Server produces the following error to avoid the
confusion where this error is expected to be caught by the TRY/CATCH steps: 

java.lang.RuntimeException: com.wm.lang.flow.FlowException: [ISC.0049.9027]
Error at pub.list:appendToDocumentList - Transformers cannot loop over list

The issue is resolved. Now, Designer displays the parameter as a drop-down
field with only true or false as options.

Integration Server experiences high CPU usage when Universal Messaging servers
are stopped in the Horizontal Scaling setup.

The high CPU usage is due to numerous Universal Messaging client sessions 
repeatedly attempting to reconnect to the stopped servers every 2 seconds.

This issue is resolved by distributing UM session re-connections over a period 
of time to prevent CPU spikes, using two newly introduced server configuration 
parameters:

    - watt.server.messaging.um.session.reconnectImmediately: Specifies whether 
      Integration Server reconnects immediately. Set the parameter to true for 
	  an immediate reconnection attempt or false to prevent the attempt. The 
	  default value is true.
    - watt.server.messaging.um.session.reconnectInterval: Specifies the interval 
	  at which Integration Server attempts an immediate reconnection. The 
	  default value is 5 seconds. There is no maximum value for this parameter. 
	  The reconnection interval is calculated as the set value plus a random 
	  value between 0 and the set value.
      For example, if there are 10 sessions, session 1 may have an interval of 5 
      seconds, session 2 may have 7 seconds, session 3 may have 9 seconds, and 
	  so on. This staggered retry mechanism prevents all sessions from 
	  reconnecting simultaneously, reducing CPU load.

You must restart Integration Server for changes to these parameters to take effect.

When you run the jcode hailmary command, if the compilation result has errors, 
the command returns the doesCompilationHasError flag as true. However, if the 
compilation result has errors and warnings, the doesCompilationHasError 
flag is false. This behaviour is because the jcode logic checks the last line 
of the compilation result to identify errors. When warnings are present, the 
jcode logic incorrectly picks up the warning text instead of the error text.

Updates to the Integration Server license verification process for
transaction-based licenses. 

Beginning with application of a fix that includes PIE-96691, the license
verification process changes for transaction-based license. Specifically,
Integration Server no longer verifies the expiration date of a transaction-based
license. If you have a transaction-based license, you must install a fix that
includes PIE-96691 before your existing license key expires. 
 
Important! If you have a core-based license for Integration Server with an
expiration date that has passed or is about to pass, you need to replace your
existing license with a Generic License Key. The Generic License Key replaces
your existing license keys when your subscription term has expired and you have
renewed the subscription with IBM. Generic License Keys are available in an
archive that can be downloaded from https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral.  For
more information about installing and using Generic License Keys, review the
README_webMethods Keys.txt file included in the archive. 
 
If you are not sure whether your products are licensed based on Transactions or

PIE-87487 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix17)
Integration Server throws java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException for some 
certificates used in an Enterprise Gateway configuration.

In an Enterprise Gateway configuration, when the internal Integration Server 
sends a certificate containing tab and newline characters 
(\r\n) to the registration port for authentication, the registration port treats 
"\r\n" as the end of the payload and fails to read the certificate, causing 
Integration Server to throw the exception.

The issue is now resolved by introducing the following server configuration 
parameter:

watt.server.enterprisegateway.cert.delimiter 
Specifies the characters that mark the end of the payload when the internal 
Integration Server sends a certificate to the Enterprise Gateway registration 
port for authentication. If the certificate includes tab and newline characters 
(\r\n), apply the fix with PIE-87487 to both the internal and Enterprise Gateway 
servers and set the parameter value to "$$". The default value is "\r\n".

Note: If you change the value of this property, you must disable and then enable
the Enterprise Gateway external port, Enterprise Gateway registration port, and 
the internal server port for the changes to take effect.

Changes for watt.client.data.maxToStringLength server configuration parameter.

The watt.client.data.maxToStringLength parameter specifies the maximum length of
the String produced by IData.toString(). When the maximum String length is
reached, Integration Server crops the value and adds an ellipses "..." at the
end. This fix introduces the following changes to the property: 

- The default value is now 65536.
- If the parameter is set to a value greater than 65536, Integration Server
writes a message to the server log at start up warning of potential performance
problems. Note that the performance of IData.toString() decreases as the value
of watt.client.data.maxToStringLength increases. 
- The minimum value is now 200. If the parameter is set to a value less than
200, Integration Server logs a message about the minimum and resets the
parameter to 200.

Integration Server does not authenticate a client certificate chain added to the 
"X-Amzn-Mtls-Clientcert" request header, resulting in the "No X509 certificate

The certificate chain is added to the request header when the client certificate 
chain is sent to Integration Server in a mutual SSL/TLS passthrough mode through 
the AWS load balancer. However, Integration Server fails to authenticate the 
certificate chain in the "X-Amzn-Mtls-Clientcert" request header, resulting in 
the error.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server authenticates the certificate

Rebuilding the Apache Lucene document repository used by the Statistics Data
Collector may negatively impact performance. 

When the Apache Lucene document repository used by the Statistics Data Collector
is purged, Integration Server rebuilds by executing an unbounded SQL select of
metrics data. When the number of rows in the database is large, executing the
unbounded query can place a heavy load on the database and negatively impact
performance. 

Now, Integration Serve rebuilds the repository by executing a collection of
bounded batches of SQL rows, which ensure the number of results for each query
is limited. 

The Apache Lucene document repository is located at:

Changes to handling of OAuth authorization codes.

Integration Server generates OAuth authorization codes and stores the codes in

exchange for the authorization code, Integration Server removes the
authorization code from cache. Integration Server executes the Remove Expired
AuthCodes system task to remove unused expired authorization codes from cache.
The watt.server.oauth.authCode.expirySeconds server configuration parameter

Configuration variables does not provide a way to specify the order in which
LDAP directories are searched. 

An Integration Server can be configured to search multiple LDAP directories for
user authentication. The order in which the LDAP directories are listed on the
Security > User management > LDAP configuration page in Integration Server
Administrator determines the order in which Integration Server searches the LDAP
directories for a user. While configuration variables (application.properties)
can be used to define an LDAP directory for an Integration Server, it does not
provide a way to specify the order in which Integration Server searches the LDAP
directories. As a result, Integration Server searches the LDAP server entries in
an arbitrary order. 

To resolve this issue, this fix introduces the configuration variable:
ldap.<uuid>.order. Use this variable to indicate the order in which Integration
Server creates and searches LDAP directories for a matching user during
authentication. Integration Server creates LDAP directories in ascending order,
starting with 1. If two or more LDAP directories are assigned the same order
number, Integration Server creates the LDAP directories with the same number in
an arbitrary order. If an LDAP directory is not assigned an order number,
Integration Server creates the directory after creating directories with an
order number. Integration Server searches the LDAP directories in the same order
in which it creates them.

In Integration Server 10.15, SFTP login fails when the Integration Server
attempts to reuse an existing SFTP session to connect to the SFTP server.

After migrating from 10.11 to 10.15, running the pub.client.sftp:login service
with reuseSession parameter set to true results in the error:
Cannot invoke "com.sshtools.sftp.SftpClient.cd(String)" because the return value
of "com.wm.app.b2b.server.sftp.client.SFTPSession.getSftpClient()" is
null.

This issue arises when a logged-in user navigates to a directory other than
the home directory. The session retains the current directory information,
which the service mistakenly treats as the default directory for subsequent
logins using the same session. Consequently, Integration Server fails to log
in to the SFTP server.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server introduces the
"watt.server.sftp.resetHomeDir" parameter that determines the user's default
default directory upon login. By default, the parameter is false. Set the
parameter to true to ensure that the user's home directory is always the default
directory upon login.

Ability to control the use of pretty print formatting for the 
pub.xml:documentToXMLString service.

By default, Integration Server uses pretty print formatting for the output of 
the pub.xml:documentToXMLString service. Pretty print uses new lines and 
indentation to make the XML String more readable in a text editor. This 
formatting might be superfluous for some situations.

To control the use or pretty print formatting for the XML String produced by 
the pub.xml:documentToXMLString, Integration Server now includes a server 
configuration parameter to set the global default value and a new service input 
parameter to control the formatting an a per service basis.

watt.server.xml.prettyPrint
Specifies whether pretty print formatting is the default for the XML String 
produced by the pub.xml:documentToXMLString service. When set to true, the 
pub.xml:documentToXMLString formats the XML String with new lines and 
indentation to make the XML more readable when viewed in a text editor. When set 
to false, the pub.xml:documentToXMLString does not use new lines or indentations. 
The default is true.

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter 
to take effect.

pub.xml:documentToXMLString input
prettyPrint - String. Optional. Flag indicating whether the service performs 
pretty print formatting for the XML String returned in the xmldata output. 
Pretty print uses new lines and indentation to make the XML String more readable

- true to perform pretty print formatting
- false to not use pretty print formatting
- <none> - to use the value specified by the watt.server.xml.prettyPrint server 
configuration parameter to determine if pretty print formatting is performed.
 
There is no default value for this input parameter.

Changes to Integration Server to address vulnerability to Server-Side Request
Forgery (SSRF) attack. 

Integration Server can now be configured to perform SSRF checking on outbound
server connections. Integration Server provides server configuration parameters
that can be used to enable SSRF checking on direct connections and redirect
connections. 

watt.net.http.connect.performSSRFcheck: Specifies whether SSRF checking is
performed for direct outbound connections. When SSRF checking is performed for
direct outbound connections, Integration Server verifies that the host to which
the request is being sent is on the allow list established by the
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist parameter. If the host is not on the allow list,
Integration Server rejects the request with the error "Connection to URL {0} is
not permitted." Set to true to enable SSRF checking for direct outbound
connections. Set to false to disable SSRF checking for direct outbound
connections. The default is false. A value of true is more secure. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

watt.net.http.redirect.performSSRFcheck: Specifies whether SSRF checking is
performed for redirected outbound connections. When SSRF checking is performed
for redirected outbound connections, Integration Server verifies that the host
to which the request is being redirected is on the allow list established by the
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist parameter. If the host is not on the allow list,
Integration Server rejects the request with the error "Redirection to URL {url}
is not permitted." Set to true to enable SSRF checking for redirected outbound
requests. Set to false to disable SSRF checking for redirected outbound
requests. The default is false. A value of true is more secure. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist: Specifies a comma-delimited list of regex
expressions for allowed host names for SSRF checking. If SSRF checking is
enabled for direct outbound connections and/or redirected outbound connections,
the host name to which the direct or redirected outbound request is being sent
must appear in the allow list established by this parameter. This parameter is
empty by default.

In a horizontal scalability setup, when one Universal Messaging (UM) node goes 
down, the Client Side Queue (CSQ) count for the webMethods messaging connection 
alias on Microservices Runtime increases.
 
Consider that Integration Server uses a Universal Messaging horizontal scalability 
URL (for example, (UM1)(UM2)(UM3)) as the Realm URL in the webMethods Messaging 
Connection Alias configuration. In this scenario, instead of routing messages to 
the remaining UM nodes in the horizontal scalability setup, the server queues the 
messages in the CSQ, which increases the CSQ count.
 
This issue is resolved by setting the watt.server.um.producer.transaction.commitRetryCount

In a repository-based deployment, custom Access Control Lists (ACLs) with 
allow/deny groups are installed correctly on the target server, but the 
associated group assignments are missing after deployment.

When deploying an ACL with allow/deny groups through a repository-based 
deployment, the ACL gets installed on the target server, but the associated 
group assignments are missing. The issue occurs because the deployment requires 
the groups to be present on both the build and target servers to create these 
associations. If the groups exist only on the target server, the ACL cannot be  
associated with the groups.

The issue is now resolved by introducing the following server configuration 
parameter:

watt.server.asset.build.enforceAclGroupAssociation
Specifies if custom ACLs deployed through a repository-based deployment include 
allow/deny groups on the target server, even if these groups are missing from 
the build server. However, you must manually add the "properties.cnf" 
configuration file with the setting
watt.server.asset.build.enforceAclGroupAssociation=true 
in the source repository folder alongside the other configuration files.
When set to true, the Asset Build Environment generates the ACDL and ZIP files, 
with ACLs that include the allow/deny group associations, regardless of whether 
the groups are available on the build server. When set to false or if the 
properties.cnf file is empty or missing from the source repository, the ACLs 
exclude the allow/deny group associations if the groups are absent from the 
build server.

Integration Server restart is not required for changes to the parameter to 
take effect.

insertion: 

watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.dbInsert.secsTimeout
Specifies the number of seconds that the Statistics Data Collector waits when
attempting to insert metrics into the database. After the timeout elapses,
Integration Server writes a debug level message to the server log about the
timeout and discards the metrics event. Once the insertion timeout occurs, the
Statistics Data Collector writes metrics to memory until the database issue
resolves or the Statistics Data Collector is disabled. After the database issue
resolves, the Statistics Data Collector inserts the queued events into the
database. Set to a positive integer or 0 (zero). A value of 0 indicates that
there is no timeout and the Statistics Data Collector will wait indefinitely to
complete the transaction for inserting metrics into the database. The default is
15 seconds. 

Do not specify a timeout value greater than the statistics data collection
interval as this may cause thread utilization for the Statistics Data Collector
to increase. The statistics data collection interval is determined by the
watt.server.stats.pollTime and has a default value of 60 seconds. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

PIE-88346 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
Journal events are not being logged.

The Event Manager in Integration Server invokes event handlers that subscribe to
specific types of events. However, Integration Server did not log Journal
events, preventing execution of event handlers that subscribed to Journal
events. 

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-88454 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
New thread dump log utility to create thread dumps that contain additional
information useful for debugging. 
 
Integration Server can now generate a thread dump log that contains additional
information, including: 
 
- The name of the service executing the thread.
- CPU time used by the thread since the JVM started.
- Amount of memory currently allocated by the thread.
- Any JDBC pool connections the thread might hold.
 
When the thread dump reporting utility is enabled, Integration Server
automatically generates the thread dump reports when one of the following
occurs: 
- The JDBC function pool does not have any available connections
- The percentage of available threads in the server thread pool drops below the
watt.server.control.serverThreadThreshold value. 
- The percentage of available stateful sessions in the session pool drops below
the watt.server.session.stateful.warning value 
 
After one of the above events occurs, Integration Server produces the following
sequence of reports: 
 
1. An initial full thread dump report
2. 30 seconds later another full thread dump report is created
3. 30 seconds later another full thread dump report is created.
 
Integration Server writes the thread dump reports  to the following log file:

<IntegrationServer_installDirectory>/instances/<instanceName>/logs/diagnostics/
tdump-<yyyy><dd><mm>-<ss>-pid<processID>.log
 
Integration Server writes messages to the wrapper.log when a thread dump log is
created, for example: 
 
INFO   | jvm 1    | 2024/05/13 07:39:14 | Produced thread dump. 
INFO   | jvm 1    | 2024/05/13 07:39:14 | Reason: Received signal to dump
threads 
INFO   | jvm 1    | 2024/05/13 07:39:14 | 
INFO   | jvm 1    | 2024/05/13 07:39:14 | Created thread dump file:
/IntegrationServer/instances/default/logs/diagnostics/tdump-2024-05-13_07-39-14-pid2870580.log
 
After Integration Server creates a set of thread dump logs, at least 10 minutes
must pass before one of the conditions discussed above will trigger another set
of thread dump logs. This interval is not configurable. 
 
Integration Server limits the disk space used by thread dump logs by setting a
disk quota of 50 MB.  After 50 MB have been allocated to thread dump longs, when
the next thread dump is triggered, Integration Server compresses all existing
thread dump log files before producing the new log.  After Integration Server
has created 50 MB of compressed thread dump logs, when the next thread dump is
triggered, Integration Server deletes the second oldest compressed file for a
thread dump from disk before creating a new log. 
 
Integration Servers uses sever configuration parameters to enable the generation
of thread dump logs and control the use of the service names in the logs. 
 
watt.server.diagnostic.threadDumper  
Whether the thread dump logging utility is enabled. Set to true to generate a
series of thread dumps when Integration Server encounters resource level limits
identified above. Set to false to disable the thread dump logger utility. The
default is true. 
 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
Integration Server writes the following to the wrapper log when the utility is
enabled: 
> INFO   | jvm 1    | 2024/05/12 13:36:08 | Registered custom signal handler for
thread dumper. (kill -USR1 2870580) 
 
Integration Server writes the following to the wrapper log when the utility is
disabled: 
> INFO   | jvm 1    | 2024/05/13 07:42:45 | Unregistered custom signal handler
for thread dumper. 
 
Note: The archive created by the diagnostic collector includes the generated
thread dump files. 
 
watt.server.diagnostic.threadNameWithService
Whether or not the thread dump report includes the fully qualified name of the
Integration Server service executing on the thread. Set to true to include the
service name in the report. The utility prepends the name of the executing
service to the name of the service originally executing on the thread. After
service invocation completes, the name of service is removed from subsequent
report entries. Only the original service name remains. 
 
Additionally, when this parameter is set to true, if a socket is bound to the
current InvokeState, the utility includes it's full address is included with the
name of the fully qualified service. Below is an example entry in the report for
the wm.server:ping service. The service connected to port 5555 using local port
56438. 
 
[tid=368]
wm.server:ping-174-_Socket[addr=/192.168.64.1,port=56438,localport=5555]
[state=RUNNABLE] 
Set this parameter to false if you do not want report entries to include the
name of the service currently executing on the thread. Only the name of the
service originally invoked with the thread will be included. 
 
The default is true.
 
Integration Server must be restarted for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 
 
Note: The thread dump logs may be explicitly triggered for non-Windows platforms
by using the 'kill 'command from a terminal shell.  Send 'kill -USR1 <pid>'
There is no limit on the number or timing of thread dumps created in this
manner. When watt.server.diagnostic.threadDumper=true, Integration Server also
creates a thread dump log when the  'kill -USR1 <pid>'  command is sent. 
 
Important!  Sending this command to an Integration Server that has
watt.server.diagnostic.threadDumper set to false, causes the JVM to exit.  In
this situation, use the 'kill -3 <pid>' or  create a diagnostic zip instead.
However, these alternatives result in Java's standard thread dump report. The
additional information provided by the thread dump logging utility will not be
included. 
 
PIE-88566 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
The pub.xml:queryXMLNode service trims leading and trailing whitespaces
in the query result.

The service must return the content of the queried field in the XML node
without modifications. However, the service trims the spaces around the
field content.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the
watt.client.node.trimBlanks server configuration parameter, which determines
whether the service trims the leading and trailing whitespaces or retains them.
Set the parameter to false to retain and true to trim the white spaces.
The default value for the parameter is true.

You do not need to restart the server for changes to the parameter to take
effect. 

PIE-92221 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
The Docker images for Integration Server and Microservices Runtime include
unused jar files with known security vulnerabilities. 

The resolution for PIE-86564 introduced logic to ensure that Docker images did
not contain unused jar files that had been replaced with updated jar files that
resolved known security vulnerabilities. However, some unused jar files continue
to appear in the Docker images. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92474 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
The Integration Server URLs are vulnerable to security threats.

If you modify a URL on Integration Server, Integration Server redirects to the

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92595 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server throws UnsupportedMediaTypeException when handling an OpenAPI 
REST request with Accept header that contains a wildcard or a combination of 
media types.

Consider a REST API Descriptor (RAD) created as a provider from an OpenAPI 
document, and the OpenAPI document can have multiple HTTP status codes in an 
operation response. Each HTTP status code can have various media types defined. 
For instance, consider that the HTTP status code 200 might include both 
application/json and application/xml. If a request has an Accept header value 
of */ * or a combination of media types (for example, Accept: application/json,
application/xml), and the response is 200, Integration Server throws 
UnsupportedMediatypeException.

This issue is resolved. Now, if a request has an Accept header value with a 
wild card or combination of media types, the response defaults to the first 
matching media type.

PIE-92825 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server fails to convert a JSON string to a document using
pub.json:jsonStringToDocument in Integration Server Administrator.

When converting a JSON string to a document (an IData object) 
using the pub.json:jsonStringToDocument service in Integration Server
Administrator, the pub.json:jsonStringToDocument service fails 
if you do not specify jsonDocumentTypeName, even though jsonDocumentTypeName is
an optional parameter. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92842 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server experiences memory issues (high resource and memory 
consumption) during design time activities such as copy, paste, rename, and so
on. 

Designer and webMethods.io show slow response times during design time
activities such as copy, paste, rename, and so on with hundreds of document type
references, resulting in high resource and memory consumption. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server performs better by optimizing
the flow service operations to minimize memory usage. 

PIE-92849 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
New default value for the indexInterval parameter which determines how often the
Statistics Data Collector queries the database for new results and creates
Lucene documents. 

The indexInterval parameter now has a default value of 90 seconds. Previously,
the default value was 300 seconds.  However, Integration Server will not set the
parameter to the new default if the indexInterval value was changed from the
default. 

The indexInterval parameter is located in
<install_directory>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instanceName>/config/monitor/monitor.cnf.

PIE-92978 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
Resolution for OutOfMemoryExceptions that may occur during debugging and while
decoding a JSON message. 

This fix addresses two situations in which OutOfMemeoryExceptions may be
observed. 

- While using Designer to debug steps in a flow service, if the pipeline
contains a very large, nested document mapped to a variable, Designer may throw
an OutOfMemoryException. To resolve this issue, Designer does not transform all
values into a String during a debugging session.  Designer only transforms the
value of variables relevant to the debug session. 

- When decoding a JSON string into a document (IData object), Integration Server
throws an OutOfMemoryException. To avoid this situation, Integration Server now
releases memory as soon as possible once the JSON string has been transformed
into a document.

Server should handle the situation more gracefully. 

Now, Integration Server no longer throws a NullPointerException when

conditions. 

java.net.SocketException: Socket output is already shutdown

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93139 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server incorrectly logs the payload of a POST API request
for the subsequent GET API request when an HTTP interceptor is in use.

The issue occurs because Integration Server reuses the socket connection
created for a request in subsequent requests when the Connection header is
'keep-alive', and does not update the payload until a new payload is received.
Therefore, when an HTTP interceptor intercepts a GET request, Integration Server
logs the payload from the previous POST request for the GET request.

This issue is now resolved. When an HTTP interceptor is in use,
Integration Server refreshes the socket connection for each request regardless
of the Connection header in the request.

PIE-93142 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
Integration Server fails to convert date or time using the
pub.date:dateTimeFormat service, if invoked from an external application. 

When using the pub.date:dateTimeFormat service from anywhere 
other than Designer, the service throws an error because the locale parameter
value is passed as an empty string. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93151 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
OpenID authentication process returns a 401 Unauthorized status when the OpenID
Provider is an Entra ID instance and the value of token_endpoint_auth_method on
the provider is "private_key_jwt". 

When the OpenID Provider is an Entra ID instance and the provider's
token_endpoint_auth_method is "private_key_jwt", the OpenID authentication
process returns a 401 Unauthorized status. This happens because Entra ID
requires the signature header in the JWT to contain the x5t and typ fields.
Integration Server does not include the fields in the header of the JWT
signature. These fields are defined as optional in the Java Web Signature
standard, but are required by Entra ID. 

This issue is resolved. If the configured OpenID Provider's issuer value
contains "microsoft," Integration Server includes the x5t and typ fields in the
header of the JWT signature.

PIE-93840 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix15)
In flat file processing, a request without a body no longer results in an null
ffdata object being added to the pipeline. 
 
After applying a fix or upgrading to a release that includes PIE-84414, when
Integration Server receives a flat file request without a body (payload), a null
ffdata object is not added to the pipeline as it was before. The change for
PIE-84414 resolves an issue where a SocketTimeOutException occurred for requests
that did not have a body and the request specified one of the following
Content-Types: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/xml, and text/xml.
However, this change is not needed for all Content-Types and can cause issues in
existing implementations that relied on the old behavior. 
 
To resolve this issue, Integration Server now includes a server configuration
parameter to process empty payloads for specific Content-Types. 
 
watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload
Specifies a comma-separated list of Content-Types for which Integration Server
processes an empty payload.  When Integration Server receives a request with an
empty payload and the Content-Type header is specified in
watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload, Integration Server processes the
empty payload with the request. For example, if
watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload is set to text/plain, when
Integration Server receives a flat file request with an empty payload,
Integration Server places a null ffdata object in the pipeline of the processing
service. If watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload does not specify
text/plain, Integration Server does not add an empty object to the pipeline when
receiving a flat file request with no payload. The default value is text/plain. 
 
Do not set this parameter to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/xml,
and text/xml as it will result in a SocketTimeOutException when Integration
Server receives requests with one of those Content-Types and with empty
payloads. 
 
You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect.

Beginning with IS_10.15_Core_Fix13, the Dockerfile generated by the is_container
script does not create the sagadmin user as the container user. 
 
Prior to IS_10.15_Core_Fix13, when generating a Dockerfile, the is_container
script created a sagadmin user which had ownership of the files in the Docker
image. This was the default behavior. A user who is logged into the container
created using that image can run commands as the sagadmin user. Beginning with
to IS_10.15_Core_Fix13, the script does not create the sagadmin user. The
generated Dockerfile needs to be modified manually to add the command that
creates the user. While the sagadmin user is not needed to run Integration
Server or Microservices Runtime in a Docker container (Docker runs everything as
root), the existence of the sagadmin user is a convenience. 
 
Now, the is_container script once again creates the sagadmin user by default. If
-Dimage.createUser=false, the is_container script does not create the sagadmin
user. 

PIE-92334 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix14)
Integration Server has a security vulnerability that allows a
Developer user to create a user and grant administrator privileges.

A user with Developer privileges can create a scheduled task using a
built-in service to add a user and run the task, even without permission
to invoke the service. Similarly, the Developer user can add a user
to the Administrators group making Integration Server vulnerable
to security risks.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the
watt.server.scheduler.checkUserAcl server configuration parameter
to validate a user invoking the service in a scheduled task.

watt.server.scheduler.checkUserAcl
Indicates whether Integration Server verifies if a user has Execute ACL
permission for a scheduler service. Set this parameter to true to enable
the verification or false to disable it. The default value is true.

characters like the rest of the input. 

Note: If your input contains 4-byte Japanese characters, the service 
may not produce the desired output if you do not set the parameter to true.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-85549 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Integration Server names the root element of REST definitions
in a resource-first REST API Descriptor (RAD) in an unexpected manner.

For a resource-first RAD, if services have associated document types,
Integration Server generates REST definitions for each document type referenced
in the Swagger document. The REST definition is named after the node name of
the document type. For example, if a document type A references document type B
with the variable name abc, the generated Swagger document automatically
generates a request or response for this operation in the Swagger editor. For
XML media types, the root element in the XML is the REST definition name, which
corresponds to the document type name. However, some users might expect the
variable name to be the root element in the autogenerated request or response. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server adds an XML tag for the REST
definitions where the XML name property has the value as the variable name
to ensure that the auto-generated root XML name is the variable name and not
the node name. 

PIE-86524 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Docker images for Integration Server and Microservices Runtime in the container
registry now indicate which fixes are installed for the image.

After upgrading the Mavericks JAR, Integration Server does not use the
sftpLicenseKey.cnf file in the IntegrationServer\instances\default\config\sftp

PIE-86812 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Integration Server 10.5 blocks incoming payload requests that include certain
file types (for example, .pdf or .png) within multipart/form-data as SQL
injection violation. 

Integration Server blocks payload requests containing specific file types 
(for example, .pdf or .png) as an SQL injection violation. Moreover, if 
incoming payload requests include such file types within multipart/form-data,
Integration Server 10.5 blocks the request at Enterprise Gateway because
multipart/form-data is not supported by the Enterprise Gateway rules. 

The issue is now resolved. If you want to instruct Integration Server to 
bypass validation for any specific content type against the SQL injection, use 
watt.server.enterprisegateway.SQLinjection.ignoreContentType system
configuration parameter. 

PIE-87359 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Integration Server generates a configuration file for the WmAssetPublisher
package even when the package is unavailable.

Despite safely deleting the WmAssetPublisher package, Integration Server
generates the assetpublisher.cnf file in packages/WmAssetPublisher/config at
some point after restart. However, generating the configuration file when the
package is absent is incorrect. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87543 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Integration Server stores the file path in the "configPassman.cnf" file for an 
encrypted package-level global variable as an absolute file path.

When you define a package-level global variable as a password, Integration 
Server uses a separate configPassman.cnf file within its corresponding package 
folder to specify the name and file path to store the encrypted passwords. The 
file path specified in the configuration file is an absolute file path.
Therefore, when you use the package on a different operating system platform, 
such as Linux, the absolute path specified in the configuration file becomes 
irrelevant, making the package being platform-dependent.

The issue is resolved by changing the file path in the configuration file to a 
relative path.

After initial login to Integration Server through LDAP fails due to an 
intermittent issue, subsequent login attempts also fail.

When the initial login to Integration Server through LDAP fails due to an
intermittent issue, subsequent login attempts to Integration Server also fail, 
requiring a server restart. However, even after restarting Integration Server, 
the connection is only briefly established before it is lost again.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87616 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Integration Server as a SOAP consumer fails to handle responses with large
payloads when Transfer-Encoding is set to chunked.

Integration Server does not invoke a response handler service for a consumer web
service descriptor when the response payload size is large, and the
Transfer-Encoding header is set to chunked. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87813 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Missing response body for undefined HTTP status codes.

When an OpenAPI document specifies a "default" schema for HTTP status codes, the
schema should be used for the response body of any undefined HTTP responses.
Therefore, if the service's output aligns with the default response body for an
undefined HTTP status code, the client should receive this default response
body. However, the response body is missing in such scenarios. 
 
This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87862 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Designer experiences delay while rendering the pipeline view for a map step.

The lack of an option to cache the missing or non-existent nodes 
impacts the performance of Designer while rendering the pipeline 
view for a map step.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides an option 
to enable the cache for non-existent nodes with a cache expiry time.

Note:
Install this fix with the corresponding Designer fix (WED-10465
(ESB_10.11_Fix7)) to resolve the issue.

The issue is resolved. Integration Server now responds with "HTTP/1.1 100
Continue" to the client, allowing the client to send the payload for further
processing in Enterprise Gateway.

PIE-88265 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Integration Server does not honor the watt.server.stats.logFilesToKeep value,
preventing logs from being removed. 

The watt.server.stats.logFilesToKeep server configuration parameter determines
the  number of statistics log files Integration Server keeps on the file system,
including the current statistics log. Integration Server did not honor the
watt.server.stats.logFilesToKeep value, keeping an unlimited number of
statistics log files. 

This issue is now resolved.

Note: The watt.server.stats.logFilesToKeep value also applies to the HTTP log.

PIE-88300 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix13)
Integration Server throws an AdminAPIException stating that it cannot initialize
the administrative API for Adapter Runtime even though the WmART package is
disabled or removed. 
 
Integration Server attempts to load the administrative API for Adapter Runtime
even though the WmART package is disabled or uninstalled. When the WmART package
is not available, this causes an AdminAPIException followed by a stack trace to
be written to the server log, specifically: 

com.softwareag.is.admin.AdminAPIException: [ISS.0030.0001]

This issue is now resolved by not using session IDs for unauthenticated users.

PIE-86815 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix11)
The sample.xslt:transformToString service in the WmXSLT package is susceptible 
to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

This issue is now resolved by introducing the watt.core.xml.loadExternalEntities 
server configuration parameter with the default value as false. 
If the parameter is set to false, the service ignores any external entities 
referenced in the input.

Note: If the parameter is set to true, the service parses the external entity 
references, which makes Integration Server vulnerable to XXE injection.

You do not need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.

While creating a docType using an XSD extracted from a generated Web Services 
Description Language (WSDL) file, if the XSD has a field that contains the XML 
namespace but without an assigned prefix for the namespace, Integration Server 
throws the following exception:

[ISC.0124.9017] Document to XSD error: Field testField cannot be represented 
in XML Schema. The field contains an XML Namespace property but the field name 
does not contain a prefix.

This issue is resolved by introducing the following server configuration 
parameter.

watt.core.schema.ignoreFieldNamespacePrefix

Specifies whether Integration Server ignores the absence of a prefix for the XML 
namespace in a field within the XSD while creating a docType using an XSD from 
a generated WSDL file. When set to true, Integration Server ignores the absence 
of the prefix, enabling Integration Server to create a docType without any error. 
The default is false.

Integration Server restart is not required for changes to the parameter to 
take effect.

After PIE-83691 resolution, Integration Server uses the named character entity 
to escape apostrophes while using pub.xml:documentToXMLString, leading to output 
compatibility issues for some users.

After applying a fix that includes the solution for PIE-83691, Integration 
Server uses the named character entity to escape single quotes or apostrophes 
while using pub.xml:documentToXMLString. However, the output format might not be 
suitable to all users.
 
This issue is now resolved by introducing the watt.server.htmlEncode.aposAsEntity 
server configuration parameter, which by default maintains the previous behavior 
of representing apostrophes as the decimal equivalent of the ASCII code rather 
than using the named character entity. When set to true, Integration Server 
encodes single quotes or apostrophes as the named character entity. The default 
value is false.
Integration Server restart is not required for changes to this parameter to take

Now, Integration Server does not perform auditing of individual fields if the 
ISCoreAudit JDBC Pool is not configured. This prevents the above exception from 
being logged.
This has been resolved. If auditing of individual fields is attempted with no 
ISCoreAudit JDBC Pool, the audit is not performed and no exception is logged.

PIE-87840 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix11)
Addition of configuration variables for LDAP cache size and time to live.

Microservices Runtime (or an Integration Server with a Microservices license) 
now supports use of the following keys in a configuration variables template 
(application.properties file):

ldap.settings.CacheSize - Corresponds to the Cache Size (Number of Users) 
field
ldap.settings.CacheTimeToLive - Corresponds to the Credential Time-to-Live 
field. However the ldap.settings.CacheTimeToLive is measured in milliseconds 
instead of minutes.

The fields corresponding to the above configuration variable keys appear on the 
Security > User Management > LDAP configuration > Edit LDAP configuration page.

PIE-87897 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix11)
Integration Server experiences slow response time for HTTP or HTTPS client calls 
during an SSL connection.

Integration Server performs a reverse DNS lookup for every client request 
before verifying the "Access Mode" setting or the IP access list 
configuration for the global or port IP access delaying the response from 
Integration Server to the client, resulting in slow response time for HTTP or 
HTTPS client calls during the SSL connection.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server performs a reverse DNS lookup 
only after verifying the "Access Mode" setting and the configuration of 
IP access lists for specific ports or globally.

PIE-87952 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix11)
The migration utility throws a ClassNotFoundException if API Gateway resides on 
Integration Server.

When executing the migration utility on Integration Server, the utility throws 
the following exception if API Gateway exists on Integration Server.

Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.softwareag.apigateway.passman.datastore.CustomDataStore

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-87957 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix11)
Calls to the health gauge endpoint on the diagnostic port for an Integration 
Server running in a Docker container return a 403.

The allow list for the diagnostic port does not include the internal services 
used to perform a health check. When the health gauge endpoint is called on the 
diagnostic port, Integration Server returns a 403 HTTP status code. This only 
occurs for an Integration Server running in a Docker container.

This issue is resolved by adding the services that perform the health check to 
the allow list for a diagnostic port running on an Integration Server in a 
Docker container.

PIE-79669 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Integration Server intermittently drops from a cluster on a regular basis,
under certain conditions.

In a clustered environment, when an Integration Server is associated with
multiple LDAP servers, and an LDAP server is not reachable, Integration Server
drops from the cluster as the error is not handled correctly.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81120 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Integration Server becomes unresponsive during database operations.

Integration Server becomes indefinitely unresponsive while obtaining 
a connection from a JDBC connections pool. However, the cause
is untraceable as the server log lacks the information to find processes
that block the database connection.

The issue is resolved. Now, the server log contains log entries 
to help identify the problematic processes.

PIE-82194 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Scheduled tasks in Integration Server are stuck in the Active state with 
Next Run value as 0.0.

When a scheduled task fails to run before the Next Run time elapses, the task 
remains in the Active state with the Next Run value as 0.0, which does not show 
that the scheduled task is delayed.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the 
watt.server.scheduler.nextRun.hidePastValue server configuration parameter 
that specifies how Integration Server displays the elapsed Next Run time for a 
scheduled task that fails to run before the Next Run time elapses. If the 
parameter is set to true, the Next Run time shown as 0.0. 
If the parameter is set to false, the Next Run time is shown with a negative
sign, indicating the delay in running the scheduled task. The default value is 
true.

You do not need to restart the Integration Server for changes to the parameter
to take effect.

When creating an OAuth client or generating a new secret for an existing OAuth
client using the Firefox browser with Integration Server Administrator, the
client_secret is not copied to the clipboard when OK is clicked. 
 
After creating an OAuth client or clicking the Generate New Secret button on the
Security > OAuth > Client registration > Edit client registration page,
Integration Server Administrator displays a dialog box stating "client_secret
cannot be seen again. Click OK to copy." Clicking the OK button when using the
Firefox browser with Integration Server does not copy the client_secret to the
clipboard. 

To address this issue, Integration Server Administrator now displays a dialog
box stating "Copy the client_secret for future usage. This client_secret
cannot be seen again." Firefox users must manually select and copy the
client_secret. 

PIE-85308 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Issues at runtime while invoking a REST API in webMethods.io Integration.

When invoking a REST API for a service associated with a Swagger-based REST API
Descriptor (RAD), Integration Server tends to convert the data type of the input
variables in the request body to the data type defined in the service signature. 

This issue is resolved. Now, webMethods.io Integration provides an option while
importing a Swagger document to decide whether to use the variable with the data
type defined in the signature or the data type in the request body. 

PIE-85362 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
The Integration Server service metrics sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis

data from the previous statistics collection interval. 

Previously, the data displayed for sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis and
sag_is_service_requests_total could be more than 5 minutes in the past. 

Now, the metrics display data from the previous statistics collection interval
which ensures that the data is no older than 2 minutes. 

PIE-85423 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Integration Server incorrectly names the first server log file after
a rollover.

When configuring size-based rollover for server log using the 
watt.server.serverlogRotateSize server configuration parameter, 
Integration Server incorrectly uses the previous day's date in the 
filename of the first log file after the rollover.

This issue is resolved. Integration Server now uses the current date in 
the filename of the first server log file after the rollover.

PIE-85485 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Integration Server incorrectly sets the default Content-Type header in  
POST or DELETE requests, even when the client does not specify the header.

Despite the absence of the Content-Type header in POST or DELETE requests, the 
pub.client:http service explicitly sets the header to the default value: 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded". However, according to HTTP 1.1, 
specifying the Content-Type header is optional. Therefore, if the client does
not include the header in the request, the pub.client:http service should not 
add it. 

The issue is now resolved by introducing the
'watt.server.http.setDefaultContentType' 
server configuration parameter, which determines whether Integration Server sets 
the default Content-Type header in the requests. If the parameter value is true, 
Integration Server sets the default Content-Type header in the request even 
though the client does not include it. If the parameter value is false,
Integration Server does not set the default Content-Type header, when it is 
originally absent in the request.

The default value of the parameter is true. However, Integration Server 
automatically sets the Content-Type header to
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" when data is passed to the pub.client:http 
service using the 'args' or 'table' keys, irrespective of the 
'watt.server.http.setDefaultContentType' parameter value.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect.

If a java.sql.SQLException repeatedly occurs while the Statistics Data Collector
is processing SQL query results, the Statistics Data Collector might write a
large number of log messages to the server log. 

While processing results from a SQL query, the Statistics Data Collector might
emit many log messages if a java.sql.SQLException is repeatedly raised while
retrieving data  This results in an inordinate number of messages in the server
log such as the following: 

[ISS.0045.0035W] (tid=###) Failed to read SQL rows. Details: [ISS.0045.0158] An
error occurred while attempting to obtain JVM statistics. Repository statistics
will not include some JVM statistics. 

With this fix, the Statistics Data Collector limits the number of log messages
it writes when a java.sql.SQLException occurs when processing SQL query results.

PIE-85675 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix10)
Security vulnerability during FTP session.
 
During an FTP session (inbound or outbound), Integration Server exposes the
admin and ns folders in packages, making Integration Server vulnerable to a
script injection. 
 
To address this security vulnerability, Integration Server includes a server
configuration parameter to hide the admin and ns folders in all packages. Set
watt.net.ftp.hide.folders to true to hide the admin and ns folders in packages
during an FTP session. Set to false to leave the admin and ns folders visible
during FTP sessions. The default is false to ensure backward compatibility with
existing solutions. 
 
You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 
 
Important! The default configuration of the new watt.net.ftp.hide.folders
parameter does not resolve the security vulnerability. After applying a fix that
includes PIE-85675, you must set watt.net.ftp.hide.folders to true to address
the security vulnerability. It is more secure to set watt.net.ftp.hide.folders
to true.

WmRoot package finishes loading: 
 
[ISS.0045.0364D] (tid=<threadID>) Statistics Data Collector is waiting for
WmRoot package to finish loading.

Single sign-on (SSO) to Integration Server Administrator for user already
authenticated via a JAAS login module is not available. 

Integration Server Administrator prompts a user for basic authentication even
though authentication was already performed by a JAAS login module. 

To address this issue, Integration Server now includes a server configuration
parameter to allow SSO to Integration Server Administrator via JAAS. 

watt.security.jaas.restrictSSO
Specifies if single sign-on to Integration Server Administrator is supported
when a user has already been authenticated via a JAAS login module. When set to
false, if JAAS authentication succeeds, access to Integration Server
Administrator does not require additional basic authentication credentials. The
Integration Server log in page is skipped and the user is instead redirected to
the Dashboard. When set to true, if JAAS authentication succeeds, the user must
still provide login credentials when attempting to access Integration Server
Administrator. The default is false. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to take
effect.

Client applications can now set the User-Agent value that JSONClient sends to
Integration Server. 

When the CSRF Guard feature is enabled on Integration Server and the
watt.net.userAgent property has been changed to something other than the default
value of "webMethods", a call from the JSONClient class to the Integration
Server results in an  HTTP 400 response code. 

To resolve this issue, the following methods have been added to
com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient: 

    public void setUserAgent(String)
    public String getUserAgent()

Client applications that use JSONClient to communicate with Integration Server
can call the setUserAgent method to specify the value that JSONClient will send
in the User-Agent request header. If setUserAgent() is not called, or is passed
null or an empty String, JSONClient will send a User-Agent value of
"webMethods". If Integration Server is using CSRF Guard, client applications
should set JSONClient's User-Agent so that it matches the watt.net.userAgent
setting on the server. If Integration Server has watt.server.http.jsonFormat set
to stream or bytes, the User-Agent value sent by JSONClient must be webMethods.
Client applications can call the getUserAgent method to see what User-Agent
value is currently in use by JSONClient.

Integration Server becomes unresponsive due to thread exhaustion resulting from
multiple active instances of a trigger's resource monitoring service. 

When Integration server encounters a transient error or exceeds maximum retry
attempts for a trigger, Integration Server suspends the trigger and runs a

After applying a fix that includes PIE-85221, Integration Server uses the
Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) hashing algorithm for
passwords for new users. However, Integration Server still uses SHA-2 to hash
passwords for users added via a configuration variables template

Enhancements to gRPC support in Integration Server.

Integration Server now supports the following gRPC features and functionality:

- gRPC field types Enum and Map.
- Custom metadata. A gRPC client and/or server can send gRPC metadata to provide
additional information about the gRPC call, such as custom header information.
At run time, Integration Server places any custom gRPC metadata received for a
gRPC request into a document field (IData object) named Custom-Metadata, adding
one child field for each key-value pair of gRPC metadata. Integration Server
passes the Custom-Metadata field to the input pipeline to the gRPC method flow
service invoked by the RPC call. Your gRPC method flow service can include logic
that makes use of the gRPC metatada. Note: The document types generated for the
gRPC message do not include fields for custom metadata.

Integration Server now includes options to control how Java lists and sets are
encoded in a JSON string. 

When Integration Server encodes a document (IData) as a JSON string, such as in
the built-in service pub.json:documentToJSONString), Integration Server encodes
an instance of java.util.List or java.util.Set as one String value. However,
this data would be more properly encoded as an array. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server now includes the following to control
how instances of java.util.List and java.util.Set are encoded in a JSON string: 

The server configuration parameter watt.server.json.encodeListsAndSetsAsArrays
determines the encoding at a server-wide level. 
The input parameter encodeListsAndSetsAsArrays for the
pub.json:documentToJSONString service determines the encoding per service
invocation. 

Details about these parameters appear below.

watt.server.json.encodeListsAndSetsAsArrays
Specifies how Integration Server encodes instances of java.util.List and
java.util.Set when converting a document (IData) to a JSON string. Set to true
to encode instances of java.util.List or java.util.Set as arrays. Set to false
to encode instances of java.util.List or java.util.Set as one String value. The
default is false. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

pub.json:documentToJSONString
encodeListsAndSetsAsArrays - String. Optional. Specifies how the
pub.json:documentToJSONString service encodes instances of java.util.List or
java.util.Set. 

Set to one of the following:
- "true" to encode instances of java.util.List or java.util.Set as arrays.
- "false" to encode instances of java.util.List and java.util.Set as one
String value. 
- <null> to use the value of watt.server.json.encodeListsAndSetsAsArrays to
determine the encoding. 
There is no default value for this input parameter.

PIE-82233 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix9)
Integration Server now includes the ability to control wither it encodes a
java.util.Map object as a JSON string or a nested JSON structure. 

When encoding IData objects as JSON, Integration Server encodes java.util.Map
objects as a JSON string instead of a nested JSON structure. To address this,
Integration Server now includes the following to determine the encoding: 

- The server configuration parameter watt.server.json.encodeMapAsString
determines the encoding at a server-wide level. 
- The input parameter encodeMapAsString in the pub.json:documentToJSONString
service determines the encoding on a per service invocation basis. 

Details about these parameters appear below.

watt.server.json.encodeMapAsString
Specifies how Integration Server encodes java.util.Map objects in JSON. Set to
true to encode Map objects as a JSON string. Set to false to encode Map objects
as a nested JSON structure. The default is true. 

For example, in the following suppose that "myKey" is an IData key with a
HashMap value that has two String keys each with a numeric value. 

"myKey" ->   "one" = 1,  "two" = 2

A value of true results in this JSON:   "myKey": "{one=2, two=1}"
A value of false results in this JSON:   "myKey" : { "one" : 1, "two" : 2 }  

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

pub.json:documentToJSONString 
encodeMapAsString - String. Optional. Specifies how the service encodes
java.util.Map objects in the document (IData). 
Set to one of the following:

- "true" to encode java.util.Map objects as a JSON string
- "false" to encode java.util.Map objects as a nested JSON structure.
- <null> to use the value of watt.server.json.encodeMapAsString to determine the
encoding.

Integration Server has scheduler issues in quiesce mode.

Consider a scheduled task that is active when Integration Server enters quiesce
mode. If the scheduled task is updated in quiesce mode, Integration Server
suspends the task. Upon exiting quiesce mode, the task remains suspended. 

This issue is resolved. Now, tasks that are active before Integration Server 
enters quiesce mode will remain active when Integration Server exits quiesce 
mode.

Additionally, when Integration Server enters quiesce mode, the order of
package unloading is changed. Integration Server now unloads custom packages
before system packages, regardless of the package dependencies defined for the
custom packages.

This has been resolved. Now, when the client uses an invalid or expired access

send the error response. If the request did not include an Accept header, the
media type of the response matches the media type of the request.

An accumulation of unused breakpoint sessions might negatively impact
Integration Server performance. 

Using Designer to execute a service in debug mode creates a breakpoint session
on Integration Server. However, breakpoint sessions do not expire and
Integration Server does not remove idle sessions. This can result in an
accumulation of breakpoint sessions on Integration Server, which can affect
Integration Server performance. 

To resolve this issue, breakpoint sessions now expire and Integration Server
includes the system task Expired Breakpoint Session Sweeper which removes
expired breakpoint sessions. Integration Server includes two new server
configuration parameters to control the expiry time and the interval with which
the system task runs. 
 
watt.server.breakpoint.session.expiryTime 
Specifies the number of minutes a breakpoint session can be idle before it
expires. A breakpoint session is created when Designer executes a service in
debug mode. The default is 30. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

watt.server.breakpoint.session.sweeperInterval
Specifies the number of minutes between execution of the system task Expired
Breakpoint Session Sweeper which removes expired breakpoint sessions. The
default is 15 minutes.

A JMS trigger does not work as expected when using Universal Messaging as the

When the JMS trigger receives messages from Universal Messaging, the "Max
prefetch size" property in the JMS trigger overrides the "Max batch messages"
property.

This issue is resolved. Now, when the "Max batch messages" property is greater
than one, Integration Server honors the property, and ignores the "Max prefetch
size" property.

The JMS trigger uses the prefetch cache only in the following scenarios:

- The JMS trigger uses concurrent processing. However, serial JMS triggers
 that receive messages from Universal Messaging cannot use prefetch caching.
- The JMS connection alias that the trigger uses to fetch messages has
the transaction type set to NO_TRANSACTION.
- The JMS trigger receives messages from multiple destinations, and the number of
destinations matches the value set for the "Connection count" property.
- The "Max prefetch size" property of the JMS trigger is greater than one.
- The "Max batch messages" property of the JMS trigger is less than two.

Integration Server sets the HPROXY and HAUTH system properties to configure the
proxy host and port while connecting to webMethods Cloud. 
However, the HPROXY property does not align with other proxy 
settings, resulting in connection failures.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server only sets the HAUTH system
property using watt.net.proxy.proxyAlias. However, if the HPROXY property is
already available in the server.cnf file, remove the property manually. 
If watt.net.proxy.proxyAlias is not set and a default proxy is configured,
Integration Server still sets the HAUTH system property according to the default
proxy configuration. 

Additionally, Integration Server now defines the "http.nonProxyHosts" system
property using the values set for the watt.net.proxySkipList property. 
For example, if watt.net.proxySkipList is localhost, host.example.com, 
Integration Server sets the http.nonProxyHosts value as
localhost|host.example.com

When migrating from 10.11 to the latest version, if the imported 
ACDL file contains a global variable name with a "." character, Integration 
Server considers the global variable as a package variable, leading to blank 
values for the global variable.
With the introduction of package variables in Integration Server 10.15, package 
variables names are in the <<pkgname.varname>> format. Therefore, in the ACDL 
file generated in 10.15, Integration Server substitutes the "." character 
with ".." to prevent ambiguity. As a result, ACDL files created in earlier 
versions that do not support package variables fail to function as expected.

LDAP and CDS groups can be assigned to allow or deny lists for ACLs (Access
Control Lists) using a configuration variables template. 

Previously, only local groups could be assigned to the allow or deny lists for
ACLs using a configuration variables template (application.properties). Groups
defined in LDAP and CDS (Common Directory Services), which are external
directories could not be assigned to ACLs using a configuration variables
template. This was limiting. 

Now, LDAP and CDS groups can be assigned to allow or deny lists for ACLs (Access
Control Lists) using a configuration variables template. To add groups defined
in LDAP or CDS to the allow or deny list for an ACL, add the prefix "ldap/"
or "cds/" followed by the group name. For example, the following key=value
pair adds the LDAP user myLdapUser and the CDS user myCentralUser to the allow
list for the Administrators ACL: 

acl.Administrators.allow=ldap/myLdapUser, cds/myCentralUser

Note: Local groups can include the "local/" prefix with the group name but
do not have to. 

In addition to the above changes, a configuration variables template can now be
used to add LDAP groups directly to the LDAP configuration file. The LDAP Group
asset supports a single key named ldapgroup.<groupName>.dn which corresponds to
the distinguished name of the group. The <groupName> is the alias that
Integration Server will use to store information about the LDAP group once it is
created by applying the template. 

For example:
ldapgroup.myGroupName.dn=cn\=generalgroup,ou\=company,dc\=example,dc\=com 

The above example includes backslashes () to escape equal signs.

situation: 

- The REST API Descriptor (RAD) is created from a service with a signature that
contains document types defined using XML schemas (that is, 
the XML content type properties are defined).
- The document type includes one or more variables with a name that begins with
the '@' symbol. 
Now, Integration Sever treats the fields that begin with the '@' symbol as
attributes in the generated Swagger document and will include an XML property
definition for such fields. The fields are returned as attributes during runtime
if the media type is in XML format. 

Important:
The variables starting with '@' are treated as an attribute only if the XML 
Content type property is set for the variable. If the variable name starts with 
'@' and the XML content type is not set, then the resulting Swagger document
includes a field name that starts with '@'.

Error responses sent to clients might contain too much information.

When a service ends because of a ServiceException, the error response returned
to a client potentially reveals significant information about the server,
service, and requesting user that could be exploited. The following fields might
be included in a response: $error, $localizedError, $errorType, $stackTrace,
$service, $pipeline, $user, $timestamp, and $contextID. 

Integration Server already includes the watt.server.http.returnException server
configuration parameter which determines whether the $stacktrace is returned to
the client along with the $error (the error message). This fix introduces new
values for watt.server.http.returnException which provide more control over what
information is returned to the calling client. The new values are: 

- brief - Returns all of the fields with the exception of $stackTrace.
- message - Returns $error and $contextID (context ID used for audit logging)
only. This is the most secure option as it returns the least amount of
information. 
- verbose - Returns all of the fields. This is the default.
- webMethods - Returns all of the fields only if the client's HTTP user agent is
set to webMethods or has the same value as the user agent specified in the
watt.net.userAgent parameter. If the user agent in the HTTP request does not
match the watt.net.userAgent value, the response contains $error and $contextID
only. Do not set watt.server.http.returnException to webMethods in a production
environment. A request submitted with the header "User-agent: webMethods" would
return sensitive information that could be misused. 

Note: Previously, the watt.server.http.returnException parameter accepted values
of true and false. These values are still honored. A value of true corresponds
to verbose. A value of false corresponds to brief. 

Note: If a service explicitly sets a response body by invoking
pub.flow:setResponse or pub.flow:setResponse2 and that service end with an
exception, the HTTP response will have a 500 status code but will not contain
the error message, stack trace, or other exception details. The response body
contains only what was set by invoking pub.flow:setResponse or
pub.flow:setResponse2.

Integration Server inconsistently maps the Swagger document variables for
integer and number data type without a format.
 
Consider a Swagger document that contains properties of integer or 
number data type without a format. When creating a REST API Descriptor (RAD)
from such a Swagger document, Integration Server maps the integer or number type
properties as java.math.BigInteger or java.math.BigDecimal respectively. 

This fix provides an option to support the existing implementation of supporting
long and double by introducing the following server configuration parameters: 

watt.server.rest.generateLong

Specifies whether Integration Server maps a property of the integer type 
without a format in a Swagger document to java.lang.Long while creating a RAD. 
When set to true, integer variables without a format are mapped to 
java.lang.Long. The default value is false.

watt.server.rest.generateDouble

Specifies whether Integration Server maps a property of the number type
without a format in a Swagger document to java.lang.Double while creating a RAD. 
When set to true, the number type properties without a format are mapped to 
java.lang.Double. The default value is false.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to the parameters to
take effect.

PIE-84082 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix8)
Integration Server returns the "Access Denied" error when a client invokes a 
REST API through a rad directive that is in a corrupt state. 

When there are changes to a flow service, Integration Server updates the 
associated REST API Descriptor (RAD). However, if the flow service has missing 
constraints, Integration Server fails to handle the null references while 
updating the RAD, which leaves the RAD in a corrupt state. Therefore, when a
client invokes a REST API through the rad directive, Integration Server returns
the "Access Denied" error.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server ignores the missing constraints 
in the flow service, preventing the associated REST resources or services from 
being in a corrupt state, and also logs information about the missing
constraints in the server log.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the
watt.server.json.decode.maxStringLength parameter to override
the limit on maximum string length. The default value is 2147483647
(the maximum possible value for any integer variable in Java). 
You must restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter

Integration Server does a reverse DNS lookup during an SSL connection. 

Integration Server does a reverse DNS lookup during an SSL connection with
a client despite having the client's IP address in the "Allow" or "Deny" list for 
port-specific IP access or global IP access.

This issue is resolved by introducing the following server configuration 
parameters:

- watt.server.ipaccess.disableRDNSLookup.global

Specifies whether Integration Server performs a reverse DNS lookup during an SSL
connection with a client if the client's IP address is in the "Allow" or "Deny" 
list for global IP access. When set to "true", Integration Server disables 
the reverse DNS lookup during an SSL connection. The default is false.
Integration Server bypasses the reverse DNS lookup for a client in the 
following situations:

- Global IP Access Setting is "Deny by Default" and "Allow List" has the
    client's IP address.
- Global IP Access Setting is "Allow by Default" and "Deny List" has the
    client's IP address.

Integration Server restart is required for the changes to take effect.

- watt.server.ipaccess.disableRDNSLookup.ports
Specifies a comma-separated list of ports that Integration Server uses to bypass
Reverse DNS lookup of client IP addresses in the "Allow" or "Deny" list while 
establishing an SSL connection with a client. By default, the parameter value is 
blank. Integration Server bypasses the reverse DNS lookup for a client in the 
following situations:

- Port IP Access Setting is "Deny by Default" and "Allow List" has the
    client's IP address.

Requests without a body might cause a SocketTimeoutException.

HTTP requests using the POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE methods can include a body.
For some content types, when these requests are sent to Integration Server

PIE-84507 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix8)
Decoding failure that occurs because the Protocol Buffer descriptor used with
the webMethods messaging trigger cannot be found will now be treated as a
transient error. 

When a webMethods messaging trigger receives a message encoded as a protocol
buffer, the trigger needs the protocol buffer descriptor created for the
publishable document type to decode the message. If the publishable document
type is not loaded at the time of decoding, the decoding fails due to a
MessagingCoderException. The trigger treated the decoding failure as a fatal
error and acknowledged the message to the messaging provider. However, the
decoding failure might be a transient error in some situations, such as when the
package that contains the publishable document type has not yet loaded at the
time the trigger attempts decoding. 

To address this possibility, the trigger now treats a decoding failure that
occurs because the trigger cannot find the protocol buffer descriptor as a
transient error. If a MessagingCoderException occurs, Integration Server can
suspend the trigger and rollback the message when one of the following is true: 

- watt.server.trigger.preprocess.suspendAndRetryOnError=true
- The trigger is configured to suspend and retry later.

Rolling back the message to the provider makes it possible for the trigger to
receive and process the message again later.

Integration Server ignores the enumeration constraints, and the document types
and services does not include the defined enumerations. Additionally,
Integration Server ignores the validation for enumerations despite selecting the
"Validate Input" or "Validate Output" checkboxes. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server supports enumeration if the 
parameter or property type is String. The Content type list displays the 
enumeration constraints, and Integration Server validates the constraints 
at runtime.

Improvements for using regular expression to specify the allowed host names for
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) checking. 

The existing support for specifying hostnames for SSRF checking was limited in
that it used a special character in java.util.regex as a delimiter, specifically
a comma (,). Integration Server uses java.util.regex for regular expression
pattern matching SSRF host names with the value of the
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist server configuration parameter. 

To make it possible to use more powerful regular expressions in
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist, Integration Server now includes a server
configuration parameter for setting the delimiter character. Additionally,
Integration Server supports the use of a backslash "\" as an escape
character, allowing the delimiter to be used in the regular expression. 

watt.net.http.ssrf.listDelimiter

Specifies the character to delimit the Java regular expressions in
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist. The default is a comma (,). Note that the comma is
s special character in java.util.regex. Specifying a semicolon (;) as the
delimiter allows more powerful expressions to be specified in
watt.net.http.ssrf.alllowlist. If you change the delimiter, make sure to update
the watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist to use the new delimiter.

This issue is resolved. Integration Server provides the 
"watt.server.http.404.responseWithURL" server configuration parameter that 
controls the response messages to invalid HTTP requests. 

watt.server.http.404.responseWithURL

Specifies whether Integration Server adds the requested resource name to the 
404 response when a HTTP client sends an invalid URL request. If the parameter
is set to true, Integration Server responds with "Object Not Found (URL name)". 
If the parameter set to false, Integration Server responds with "Object Not

Enhancements for using master password with a Docker container and a

Integration Server provides the following enhancements for using master
passwords: 

- Changing the master password for an Integration Server running in a Docker
container by supplying the password in the SAG_IS_MASTER_PASSWORD_KEY
environment variable when you start the container. 

- Using the master password as the encryption/decryption key for values in a
configuration variables template (also called an application.properties file).
When the watt.server.configVariables.useMasterKey is set to true and the master
password is 16, 24, or 32 character String, Microservices Runtime (or an
Integration Server with a Microservices license) uses the master password as the
key for encrypting and decrypting values in a configuration variables template.
A more complete description of the parameter follows. 

watt.server.configVariables.useMasterKey
Specifies whether Microservices Runtime uses the master password to encrypt and
decrypt values in a configuration variables template (application.properties
file). Set to true to instruct Microservices Runtime to use the master password
for encrypting and decrypting values in a configuration variables template. Set
to false to use the configuration variables encryption key if one is specified
or fall back to the default encryption key. The default value is false. 

If watt.server.configVariables.useMasterKey is set to true and the master
password is not a 16, 24, or 32 character String, Microservices Runtime uses the
configuration variables encryption key set by the
SAG_IS_CONFIG_VARIABLES_ENC_KEY environment variable or the
configvarsencryptionkey startup switch. If a configuration variables key is not
set, Microservices Runtime falls back to the default encryption key for
encrypting and encrypting configuration variables. 

You must restart Microservices Runtime for changes to this parameter to take
effect.

Metering simulator now writes service metering log messages to a separate log
file. 

The metering simulator enables the logging of messages for services that would
be metered and therefore generate transaction data when the webMethods Metering
Agent is in use on Integration Server. Previously, the metering simulator wrote
logging data for metered services to the server log. Because the server log can
grow very large and contain data from all the subsystems in Integration Server,
log message for metered services can be hard to find. 

To make it easier to view and analyze service metering data, the metering
simulator now writes to the metering log file.  The metering log is a
comma-separated values file located in:
<IntegrationServer_directory>\instances\<instanceName>\logs 

The frequency with which the metering log rotates is determined by the
watt.server.statsLogRotateInterval, which also controls the statistics log
rotation. Integration Server names the rotated log metering<timestamp>.csv. 

The metering log contains the following fields:
- timestamp: Timestamp at which the metering simulator wrote the log entry to
the metering log. 
- svcName: Name of the top-level service for which the metering simulator is
generating metrics. 
- tenant: The tenantID. If the tenant is null, such as in a self-hosted
runtime, the metering simulator inserts a blank space in the tenant field. 
- user: Name of the user that initiated the transaction.
- duration: Duration of the service, measured in milliseconds.
- trans_count: Number of transactions counted for this single service
invocation. If the duration is less than 3 seconds, the count will be 1. If the
duration exceeds 3 seconds, additional transactions will be counted for each 3
second interval. If your license key determines a different transaction duration
value, the simulator will use that value to determine the number of transactions 

Note: The fields in the metering log are similar to what the metering simulator
previously wrote to the server log with the following differences: 
- user information is now included
- cpu data is not included
- serviceName is now svcName
- transactions is now trans_count

If one of the media type value in the Accept header is defined in the RAD,
Integration Server returns the response in the same format.
If there is a media type value in the Accept header that is not defined in the

confidential client in the Secret field. By default, Integration Server masks
the client_secret. However, clicking Reveal Secret displays the client_secret in
clear text. Further, using a browser to inspect an element on the Edit client
registration page allows the client_secret to be viewed. This is a security
vulnerability. 

This fix introduces the following changes to address this security
vulnerability: 

- Upon successful registration of a confidential client, Integration Server
Administrator displays a dialog box containing the generated client_secret. Copy
the client_secret and save it to a secure location. Once the dialog box closes,
you cannot view the client_secret again. 
- The Edit client registration page no longer includes the Secret field and
Reveal Secret button. 
- The Edit client registration page now includes the Generate New Secret button
for a confidential client. Click Generate New Secret to get a new client_secret. 
- The Integration Server Administrator API includes an endpoint for generating a
new client_secret for an existing OAuth client: 
   PUT /admin/oauth/clientsecretupdate

PIE-76876 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
Issue while handling transient error processing.

You can configure Integration Server to retrieve multiple messages from
Universal Messaging for a JMS trigger with each request by using the prefetch
cache. You can enable the prefetch cache by setting the Max prefetch size
property to a value greater than 1 (in the trigger setting). However, the
feature is limited only to concurrent, non-transacted, and non-batched JMS
triggers. The prefetch functionality allows fetching multiple messages
simultaneously and processing them individually. 
Consider that a thread retrieves a batch of messages, and one of them remains
unacknowledged. In such a situation, Integration Server incorrectly indicates
that the remaining messages are acknowledged. These messages are redelivered
causing duplicate processing of the trigger. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server will skip processing the
remaining messages if any of the message from the prefetch batch is
unacknowledged.

PIE-79162 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
Improvements to Statistics Data Collector for gathering JVM statistics.

The following improvements for gathering and storing JVM statistics are now
available: 

- Increased fault-tolerance and diagnostic logging during statistics collection.
- Compressed storage of metric data in the IS_MONITOR table thus requiring fewer
rows. 
- Server and JVM statistics data are available earlier during the Integration
Server startup. Previously, 6 minutes might elapse before delivery of data to
the Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator. 

This fix also resolves the issue in which some JVM-related Prometheus metrics
where missing when the /metrics endpoint was called. 

PIE-80705 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
XML transformations that involve external entities pose a security risk.

This issue is resolved. Now, the pub.xslt.Transformations:transformSerialXML
service considers only the loadExternalEntities and the
watt.core.xml.allowedExternalEntities values for XML transformations, while the 
watt.core.xml.expandGeneralEntities value has no effect on the transformations.

PIE-81827 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server now logs the following message during start up to indicate
whether the Statistics Data Collector is enabled or disabled: 

Statistics Data Collector enabled? {0}

Where the {0} is replaced with true or false.

PIE-81837 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
Collection of JVM statistics appears to stop.
 
The Statistics Data Collector in Integration Server uses data returned by the
JVM statistics collector to populate the JVM metrics tab in the Integration
Server Administrator dashboard. An issue with the JVM might cause the JVM
statistics collector to stop gathering data. 
 
The Statistics Data Collector now periodically checks the state of the JMV
statistics collector and restarts the JVM statistics collector if it has
stopped. 
 
Integration Server now also includes a server configuration parameter that
indicates how soon JVM statistics collection begins after Statistics Data
Collector starts up. 
 
watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.jvmStats.startSecs
Specifies when the Statistics Data Collector begins collecting JVM statistics
once Statistics Data Collector start up completes. The Statistics Data Collector
in Integration Server uses collected JVM statistics to populate the JVM metrics
tab in the Integration Server Administrator dashboard. Specify an integer
greater than or equal to 0.  A value of 0 indicates that JVM statistics
collection begins as soon as the Statistics Data Collector completes its
startup.  The default value is 0. 

For changes to this parameter to take effect, you must either restart
Integration Server or disable and then re-enable statistics data collection for
the Dashboard.

PIE-82296 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
Integration Server takes a longer time to enter quiesce mode.

Entering quiesce mode, if there are shutdown services while disabling
packages, Integration Server waits for the shutdown services to reach
completion. If there are shutdown services that take longer time 
to complete, Integration Server waits indefinitely.

watt.server.quiesce.force

Specifies whether Integration Server disables a package forcefully. Set the 
parameter value to true to disable the packages forcefully. 
Forcefully disabling a package, terminates the running shutdown services.
Integration Server even terminates the threads for the user-scheduled tasks and
the user-triggered tasks before starting the package disabling. The default
value is false. 

watt.server.quiesce.force.timeout

Specifies the time in milliseconds that Integration Server waits to disable 
each package. If a shutdown service runs longer than the specified time, 
Integration Server terminates the shutdown service. The default value is 
1000 milliseconds.

Important:
Use these parameters cautiously, as forcefully disabling the package 
can result in data loss. Software AG recommends setting a wait time 
of 30 seconds to allow the shutdown services to complete gracefully.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to 
these parameters to take effect.

After migrating Integration Server (IS) to version 10.15, on start-up of IS, 
if there is an API Gateway license, the "Access Mode" for an Enterprise Gateway 
(EG) external port in API Gateway is set to "Deny by Default" with the list of 
the allowed services. However, the "Access Mode" must be "Allow by Default"

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-82501 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
Invoking a service on an Enterprise Gateway (EG) external port in API Gateway 
results in the 'Access Denied" error.

When creating an EG external port in Integration Server Administrator, 
the "Access Mode" is set to "Deny by Default" with the list of allowed 
services to run from the port. Hence, invoking any other service on the EG 
external port in API Gateway results in the 'Access Denied" error.

This issue is resolved. Now, the "Access Mode" is set to "Allow by Default" 
with an empty list of denied services.

Security log contains password information in clear text for user defined in
Common Directory Services (CDS). 
 
If the security log is enabled and configured to log information about user
creation and/or password changes, creating or updating a user in CDS results in
the user name and password appearing in clear text in the security log in the
Message column. This is a security vulnerability. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server now includes a server configuration
parameter to hide payload information for user account changes in CDS. By
default, the security log will not include the payload in log entries written
for creating or changing user accounts for CDS users. 

watt.server.securityLog.excludePayload
Specifies whether the Message column in the security log includes the payload
for log entries written for creating or changing user accounts for users in CDS.
Set to true to obscure the payload, which includes the user name and password in
clear text, and display the text "Payload: hidden for security purposes"
instead. Set to false to display the payload in the Message column. The default
value is true, which is more secure. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

This parameter does not impact security log entries written for creating or
changing locally defined user accounts or LDAP accounts. Security log entries
for configuration changes to LDAP and local accounts do not include the
password.

webMethods.io Integration is slow during package deployment.

In webMethods.io Integration, when deploying packages from 
one environment to another, Integration Server checks the

This issue is resolved by providing an option for webMethods.io 
Integration to specify a flag indicating whether the dependent nodes for REST

PIE-83387 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix7)
A value placed in cache by a pub.cache* service cannot be retrieved with the key
if a com.wm.data.IData object was used as the key. 
 
If an IData object was used as the key when placing a value in cache using a
pub.cache* service, later attempts to retrieve the value using the same key
might fail. This occurs because IData objects are mutable. 
 
To address this issue, Integration Server now includes the server configuration
parameter watt.server.cache.iDataKey.toString  that specifies whether a
com.wm.data.IData object used as a key in one of the pub.cache* services is
converted to an immutable String before accessing the cache. Set to true to
convert an IData object used as a key to a String. Set to false to keep the key
as an IData object. The default is true. 
 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
Important! If the IData object is modified after it has been used as a key,
Integration Server will not be able to retrieve values stored with the key
regardless of the value of watt.server.cache.iDataKey.toString. 
 
Software AG does not recommend using an IData object as a key with a cache as
IData objects are mutable. Instead, use a java.lang.String object as a key.

Statistics Data Collector incorrectly excludes some statistics for REST APIs.

When the Exclude system services check box is selected on the APIs page of the

excludes data from automatically generated services. The Exclude system services
check box was intended to exclude metrics data produced by a service in Wm*
system package. However, the Statistics Data Collector treats services generated
automatically when creating assets in Designer as system services. 

To address this issue, the Statistics Data Collector no longer excludes services
from its metrics gathering for REST APIs.

Integration Server uses the graphql-java-9.4.0.jar library, which has the
CVE-2022-37734 vulnerability. For details about the vulnerability, see
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE- 2022-37734 

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server uses "graphql-java-17.5.0.jar" 
to address the vulnerability. 

Important: The updated JAR requires significant modifications to the schema 
definitions that were created based on previous versions of the JAR. The 
updated JAR imposes several constraints that affect your schema definitions. 
For example:

Implementing multiple interfaces requires using "&" as a separator instead of a 
comma. 
Two interfaces cannot have a common field name.
Defining a new field by extending a type, interface, or input type is not
permitted. 
Extended scalar types such as Long, Short, Char, BigDecimal, BigInteger are not
implicitly supported. 
Depending on the impact of the updated JAR on your current implementation, you
may need to recreate existing assets or redefine the schema. Given that the 
updated JAR introduces breaking changes, it is strongly recommended that you 
contact Software AG support for assistance with your GraphQL workflows.

A configuration variables file (application.properties file) is ignored if the
license file for Integration Server cannot be read at start up. 

If Integration Server cannot read the license file at start up, Integration
Server proceeds with start up and the server will shut down after 30 minutes. In
this situation, Integration Server does not apply any present configuration
variables file (application.properties), resulting in Integration Server
starting up with the wrong configuration. 

Now, if the Integration Server license file cannot be read during start up and a
configuration variables file is present, Integration Server does not proceed
with start up and logs the following error:

Enhancement to customize the HTTP access log format.

You can now configure Integration Server to customize the HTTP access log by 
specifying only the required fields from a predefined list in the order of your
preference. To configure Integration Server to write HTTP log entries according 
to your preferences, the watt.server.httplog server configuration parameter now 
accepts a new value, extended. The new server configuration parameter, 
watt.server.httplog.fields allow you to specify the required fields in the log.

watt.server.httplog.fields
Specifies a comma-separated list of fields that Integration Server logs in 
the HTTP access log. You can specify the fields from a predefined list, and 
in the required order.

For example,
watt.server.httplog=extended
watt.server.httplog.fields=uid(TEST_),'header/X-Forwarded-For',
timestamp(yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS),method,url,responseCode,serverIp,
clientIp,elapsedTime,responseSize

In the generated log, a space separates the values and the empty field values
are replaced by a hyphen. You can also specify values in double quotes ("") or
single quotes (''). If the provided field is not from the predefined list, then
Integration Server ignores the field.

The predefined list of fields:

uid (Unique ID for a log entry based on timestamp. You can also
prepend a prefix to the ID. For example, uid(SAG_)) 
host
protocol
username
timestamp (You can also specify the format. For example, timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd))

PIE-81644 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix6)
Terracotta Server Array removes an Integration Server from the cluster due to
excessive session expirations. 

When a session expires, Integration Server updates the SessionStore cache which
is unnecessary because Ehcache manages expiration of cache elements.
Additionally, it creates work for the SessionStore cache. In a cluster, the
Integration Server update to the SessionStore cache generates unnecessary cache
event notifications that have to be processed by Integration Server. When this
load on the SessionStore cache is very high, Integration Server can become
temporarily unresponsive, causing the Terracotta Server Array to remove the
Integration Server instance from the cluster. 

This fix removes the unnecessary update by to the SessionStore cache made by
Integration Server when a session expires. In turn, this eliminates the cache
event notifications for session expiration, which improves server performance.
As a result, Integration Server will no longer be removed from a cluster due to
excessive session expiration processing.

Resolved issues for webMethods messaging.
 
This fix addresses the following issues in webMethods messaging:

- The request-reply channel for a stateless Integration Server has a new ID
every time Integration Server starts. Over time, this results in a build-up of
request-reply channels on Universal Messaging. 
- Integration Server does not honor the value of the Enable Request-Reply
Channel and Listener check box. 
- Refreshing triggers is not thread safe and might cause messages to be stuck
until the Universal Messaging connection alias restarts. 

The following paragraphs provide more information about these changes.

Persisting of Request-Reply Channel ID for a Stateless Integration Server
In webMethods messaging, Integration Server uses a dedicated request-reply
channel and listener. The channel name includes a unique ID generated the first
time that Integration Server starts. However, if Integration Server is stateless
(for example, when running in a stateless container), the generated ID is not
saved to disk and does not persist across server restarts. This results in the
creation of new request-reply channel on Universal Messaging every time
Integration Server restarts. Over time, the unused channels build up on
Universal Messaging. (A stateful Integration Server persists the unique ID to
disk and uses the same request-replay channel name across restarts.) 

To prevent the build up of unused request-reply channels, Integration Server
provides a configuration option to automatically delete the request-reply
channel when the connection to Universal Messaging is lost. Set
watt.server.messaging.requestReply.useTempChannel to true to delete the
dedicated request-reply channel and listener shortly after the connection to
Universal Messaging is closed (this occurs when the alias is stopped). If the
connection to Universal Messaging is lost and then restored quickly (that is,
before the channel is deleted), Integration Server uses the same request-reply
channel. Setting watt.server.messaging.requestReply.useTempChannel to true
effectively makes the request-reply channel a temporary channel. Set
watt.server.messaging.requestReply.useTempChannel to false to keep the
request-reply channel on Universal Messaging across restarts of the Integration
Server. 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
Enable Request-Reply Channel and Listener check box
In Integration Server Administrator, the use of a dedicated request-reply
channel and listener can be configured on a per connection alias basis via the
Enable Request-Reply Channel and Listener check box. However, Integration Server
ignored the check box configuration and a dedicated channel and listener was
always used. 
Now, Integration Server honors the value of the Enable Request-Reply Channel and
Listener check box. If the check box is cleared, Integration Server does not use
a dedicated request-reply channel to retrieve replies to requests sent using the
connection alias. 
 
Thread Safety when Refreshing webMethods Messaging Triggers
When a channel is manually deleted or edited on Universal Messaging during
runtime and when an Integration Server is connected to the channel, Integration
Server refreshes the trigger automatically. However, the act of refreshing the
trigger is not thread-safe and could result in the creation of two listeners for
the same trigger on the channel. As a result, messages could get stuck in the
trigger queue and remain unprocessed until the messaging connection alias used
by the trigger was refreshed. This thread-safety issue could also occur when
Designer is used to edit a trigger. 

Now, refreshing a trigger in the above scenarios are thread-safe which prevents
messages from becoming stuck in the trigger queue.

PIE-82325 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix6)
The configuration variables template file (application.properties) does not have 
the properties necessary to configure the SFTP server and user aliases. Hence,
Integration Server cannot connect to an SFTP server using application.properties. 

This issue is resolved. The application.properties file now contains the

Integration Server excludes empty document fields in REST responses.

Consider a provider REST API Descriptor (RAD) created using an 
OpenAPI document. When a client sends a request to the API, the 
provider service returns a field, which is an empty document. 
However, Integration Server excludes the field in the response
sent to the client.

This issue is resolved. Now, the empty document field is present
in the response as an empty body. For example, "field1" : {}

PIE-82709 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix6)
As part of this fix, Integration Server supports creating global variables at 
the server level or package level. All services in Integration Server have
access to a server-level global variable, while a package-level global variable
is only accessible by services within the package that has the global variable 
defined.

You can create global variables using Integration Server Administrator. In 
Settings > Global variables, add a package to which you can save the global 
variable definition. If you specify a package, Integration Server creates a 
package-level global variable; else Integration Server creates a server-level 
global variable. 

The location where Integration Server saves a global variable depends on 
whether it is a server-level or package-level global variable.

For server-level global variables, the variable definition is saved in:
Integration Server_directory\instances\instance_name\config\globalVariables.cnf

For package-level global variables, the variable definition is saved in the 
package in:
Integration Server_directory\instances\instance_name\packages\package_name\config\ 
globalVariables.cnf
When Integration Server encounters global variable substitution during service 
execution, Integration Server first looks for the global variable defined at the 
package level. If not found, Integration Server looks for the global variable 
at the server level. 

However, you can override this default behavior by specifying whether the 
service must use a server-level or a package-level global variable. To use 
a server-level global variable, prefix the variable name like this: 
%server:variablename%. To use a package-level global variable, prefix the 
variable name like this: %package:variablename%.

The server-level or package-level global variables can be created or edited 
using the configuration variables template. The assets and property names that 
correspond to the key names in the template are as follows:

Asset: Global Variable (Package-Level)
Property: Value, Key Name: globalvariable.packageName.globalVariableName.value
Property: Is Password?, Key Name:
globalvariable.packageName.globalVariableName.isSecure 
Set to true to indicate the global variable is secure or a password. 
Asset: Global Variable (Server-Level)    
Property: Value, Key Name: globalvariable.globalVariableName.value
Property: Is Password?, Key Name: globalvariable.globalVariableName.isSecure
           Set to true to indicate the global variable is secure or a password.

PIE-82855 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix6)
When decoding a large XML document with a deep tag structure, Integration Server
may become unresponsive. 
 
When Integration Server decodes an XML document, the XMLCoder inserts spaces for
indenting for each level of XML tag and newlines. When decoding a large XML
document with a deeply nested tag structure, the XMLCoder may be attempting to
insert thousands of spaces and newlines to show hierarchy. While this "pretty"
processing makes the XML more human readable when viewed in a text editor, it
may cause Integration Server to become unresponsive. 
 
To mitigate this issue, Integration Server now includes the ability to disable
pretty processing by the XMLCoder. When the XMLCoder perform pretty processing,
it inserts spaces and new lines, making the XML more readable when viewed in a
text editor. If pretty processing is not performed, the XMLCoder does not insert
spaces or newlines. When viewed in a text editor, the resulting XML appears as a
long string and is not very human readable. 

Integration Server now includes a special HTTP header to disable the pretty
function when the XMLCoder decodes an XML document received in a request.  When
an incoming request includes the header $$$webm-xmlcoder-pretty:false, the
XMLCoder does not perform pretty processing for nested tags. That is, the
XMLCoder does not insert spaces for XML tag level indentation or newlines. This
may prevent Integration Server from becoming unresponsive when XMLCoder
processes a large XML document with deeply nested tags. If the incoming request
does not include the header $$$webm-xmlcoder-pretty or includes
$$$webm-xmlcoder-pretty:true, the XMLCoder performs the pretty processing. 
 
In addition, the com.wm.util.coder.XMLCoder class now includes the following
methods that can be used when decoding XML documents from Java services. 

setPretty (Boolean enabled)
Sets a Boolean flag that specifies whether XMLCoder insert a space for each
nested tag level when processing an XML document. 
Parameters:
pretty - A Boolean specifying whether the XMLCoder performs pretty processing.
Set to enabled for the XMLCoder to perform pretty processing by inserting a
space for each nested tag level. Set to disabled to skip pretty processing. 
 
isPretty( )
Returns a Boolean indicating if the XMLCoder performs pretty processing by
inserting a space for each nested tag level when processing an XML document. 
Returns pretty=enabled if pretty processing is enabled. Else returns
pretty=disabled.

Incorrect inactiveCount flag in the log messages of webMethods messaging
triggers. 

In the log messages of webMethods messaging triggers, there is an 
"inactiveCount" flag that indicates the number of times the trigger's poll for 
a message is inactive. However, Integration Server does not reset the 
flag when the trigger successfully processes a new message. As a result, the
inactiveCount keeps incrementing, suggesting a high count for the flag. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server resets the flag to zero when 
webMethods messaging trigger receives a message for processing.

PIE-79139 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server does not remove expired OAuth tokens from the database or
cache properly, resulting in a NullPointerException. 
 
To ensure that expired OAuth tokens are properly removed from the database and
evicted from cache, Integration Server now uses a system task to check for and
remove expired OAuth tokens. The frequency with which Integration Server runs
the system task named Expired OAuth Token Cleanup and the number of expired
tokens that the task removes is determined by the
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.interval and
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.maxRows server configuration parameters,
respectively. 
 
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.interval
Specifies the frequency, measured in minutes, with which the Expired OAuth Token
Cleanup system task runs and removes expired OAuth tokens from the cache and
database. The default is 60. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 
 
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.maxRows
Specifies the maximum number of rows (expired tokens) removed from cache and
database when the Expired OAuth Token Cleanup system task runs. The default is
100. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

To improve troubleshooting, this fix also adds more logging at Trace level for
the server log facility 0010 OAuth.

PIE-79729 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Changes in how Integration Server handles the expiration of cached OAuth tokens
and the removal of expired OAuth tokens from the database. 

Prior to this fix, the removal of an expired OAuth token from the database was
linked to the expiration of cached OAuth tokens. Now, Integration Server handles
these two activities separately. 

Expiration and removal of expired OAuth tokens from cache

The elements in the OAuthTokens cache and the OAuthAccessTokens cache have a
time-to-live. When the time-to-live elapses, Ehcache evicts the elements.
However, Ehcache does not usually remove the elements from the cache as soon as
they expire. Instead, Ehcache removes expired elements when it needs to make
room for new elements. Previously, Integration Server explicitly removed expired
access tokens from the token cache. Now, Integration Server relies on Ehcache to
remove expired elements. 

Removing expired OAuth tokens from the database

Prior to this fix, Integration Server listened for notifications about expired
OAuth access tokens from Ehcache. In response to a notification, Integration
Server deleted the access token from the database. Now, Integration Server no
longer listens for these notifications. When an OAuth token expires in Ehcache,
Integration Server does not delete the token from the database. Instead,
Integration Server uses the scheduled system task Expired OAuth Token Cleanup to
remove expired tokens. This system task, which is added to Integration Server to
resolve PIE-79139, executes the pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens service at a
regular interval. See the description of PIE-79139 for details on how to control
the frequency and behavior of the Expired OAuth Token Cleanup scheduled system
task. 

In addition to the above changes, the process Integration Server uses to delete
expired tokens form a database has changed. The
pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens service deletes expired access tokens from
the database by performing a series of delete operations in the database.
Previously, the pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens service used a single SQL
statement that involved multiple database tables. If the database contains a
very large number of expired access tokens, the token deletion can take several
minutes, tying up database resources and impacting system performance. Now,
Integration Server deletes the expired tokens in batches. The size of the
batches defaults to 1000. Use the new server configuration property
watt.server.oauth.token.removal.batchSize to change the batch size. A change to
the value of watt.server.oauth.token.removal.batchSize takes effect the next
time pub.oauth:removeExpiredAccessTokens executes. Integration Server does not
need to be restarted for changes to this parameter to take effect. 

Note: Take care when making the batch size much larger than the default of 1000.
As each row is deleted, the database will create a row-level lock. A database
may choose to escalate multiple row-level locks to a single table-level lock if
it determines that an operation is creating too many locks. A large batch size
can influence a database to escalate row-level locks. This can increase the
chance of a deadlock in the database. 

As a result of the changes introduced in this fix, the
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity configuration parameter, which was
added for PIE-71548, is now obsolete. This parameter limited the queue size for
notifications about expired OAuth access token. Integration Server no longer
links removal of expired tokens from the database to notifications for expired
access tokens, making a queue for notifications about expired tokens
unnecessary. Integration Server ignores the
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity parameter.

configuration parameters to set the object class for user and group filters, 
when querying an LDAP server. Each LDAP server has a different object class for 
defining the user and group filter. For example, the user filter for Active
Directory is "objectclass=user". The user filter for Oracle Directory Server 
is "objectclass=person". 

Server configuration parameters: 

watt.server.ldap.groupObjectClass - Specifies the LDAP object class for the 
group filter. The default value is "group". The other allowed values are 
"groupofnames" and "groupofuniquenames". 

watt.server.ldap.userObjectClass - Specifies the LDAP object class for the 
user filter. The default value is "user".  The other allowed values are 
"person", "inetOrgPerson", and  "organizationalPerson". 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to 
take effect.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-80294 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Confusing error message when attempting to delete an OAuth scope that is in
currently associated with a token. 

When attempting to delete an OAuth scope, Integration Sever checks the database
to see if the scope is associated with a token. If it is, Integration Server
throws a SQL-related exception indicating that the record is present in a child
table. This message is not very informative and may cause confusion about the
real reason a scope cannot be deleted. 

Now, when a request is made to delete a scope, Integration Server first verifies
if a token is associated with an unexpired token before it attempts to delete
the scope from the database. If the scope is associated with an unexpired token,
Integration Server displays the message Scope "<scopeName>" cannot be deleted.
The scope has an association with an unexpired token. Scope not deleted. 

PIE-80315 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server now includes protobuf-java_3.19.6.jar, which addresses
security-related vulnerabilities existing in earlier versions of the jar file. 

The following security vulnerability has been reported against
protobuf-java_3.12.2.jar: CVE-2022-3171 

Integration Server now includes protobuf-java_3.19.6.jar for Protocol Buffers
which resolves the identified security vulnerability. 

PIE-80335 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server does not provide an option to disable SOAP request header 
validation. 

Integration Server validates SOAP web service request headers and does not let 
you disable the validation. Hence, a request for a SOAP web service with WS-
Security header or custom header elements, and "mustUnderstand=1" results in an 
error. 

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the 
watt.server.soap.disableRequestHeaderValidation server configuration parameter 
to enable or disable SOAP request header validation. Set the parameter to true 
to enable or false to disable SOAP request header validation. The default value 
is true. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to 
take effect.

Service page in the Integration Server Administrator. 

Now, a resubmitted service request displays a status of "Resubmitted". 

PIE-80430 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server does not provide an option to disable SOAP request

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the 
watt.server.soap.validateRequest server configuration parameter to enable or 
disable SOAP request validation. Set the parameter to true to enable or false 
to disable SOAP request validation. The default value is true. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to

document type from a JSON schema with cyclic dependencies.

PIE-80824 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
After migrating to Integration Server 10.15, regular expressions might not work
as expected or expression evaluation might end with a
java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException. 
 
Prior to version 10.15, Integration Server used the Jakarta ORO Java classes
from Apache to provide Perl 5 pattern matching when evaluating regular
expressions. This was the default behavior. Integration Server 10.11 and earlier
also provided a server configuration parameter to use the Java regular
expression pattern matching behavior defined in the java.util.regex.Pattern
class. 
 
Integration Server 10.15 GA (General Availability) always performs Java regular
expression pattern matching as described in the java.util.regex.Pattern class
because Integration Server 10.15 GA does not include the Jakarta ORO libraries.
(The Jakarta ORO project was retired by Apache in September 2010.) However, some
Perl 5 constructs are not supported by java.util.regex.Pattern. Consequently,
for solutions migrated to Integration Server 10.15, regular expressions that
relied on the Perl 5 pattern matching might no longer evaluate successfully.
Integration Server might exhibit unexpected behavior during regular expression
evaluation, such as ending with a java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException. 
 
Note: The java.util.regex.Pattern class API documentation can be found here:
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html 
The section "Comparison to Perl" identifies Perl 5 constructs that are not
supported by java.util.regex.Pattern. Keep in mind that there could be issues
that are not described in the documentation. 
 
To provide backward compatibility with regular expressions that rely on the Perl
5 pattern matching behavior, Integration Server 10.15 now includes the Jakarta
ORO libraries. After applying a fix that includes PIE-80824, Integration Server
uses the Perl 5 regular expression pattern matching by default. 
 
Integration Server now includes the server configuration parameter
watt.server.usejavaregex to switch between the Perl 5 pattern matching provided
by the Jakarta ORO libraries and the Java regular expression pattern matching
provided in the java.util.regex.Pattern class. 

watt.server.usejavaregex
Specifies whether pattern matching for regular expressions is done using Java
regular expression pattern matching or Perl 5 pattern matching. Set
watt.server.usejavaregex to true to use the Java regular expression pattern
matching provided in the java.util.regex.Pattern class. Set
watt.server.usejavaregex to false to use the Perl 5 pattern matching provided by
the Jakarta ORO libraries. The default is false. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
Note: The Jakarta ORO project was retired by Apache in September 2010 because
there were not any new features or releases planned. Software AG strongly
recommends modifying regular expressions that relied on Perl 5 pattern matching
to use Java regular expressions.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81176 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server now provides alerts for hybrid connectivity.

A new channel, "Hybrid Connections" is added for hybrid connectivity alerts,
which are generated for the following events:

- Tenant connection disconnected
- Tenant connection restored
- Account disconnected
- Account restored

When an account connection or a tenant connection is disconnected or restored,
Integration Server notifies the user through a notification in Integration
Server Administrator followed by an email.
You can configure the hybrid connectivity notifications using
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications server configuration
parameter and the recipients of the notification emails using 
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail server configuration parameter.

Integration Server uses the email notification settings configured in
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Resources. 

Note: If the email notification settings are not configured, then change the
value of watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications to "alert" to avoid 
SMTP errors in the log.

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail
Specifies the list of email addresses to which Integration Server sends emails
about errors and warnings related to the connection status between Integration
Server and webMethods Cloud. Use a semicolon (;) as a delimiter to specify
multiple email addresses. By default, the parameter value is blank.

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications
Specifies whether Integration Server generates notifications and notifies users
when a tenant connection or an account for webMethods Cloud is disconnected or
restored. The parameter can have one of the following values:

- alert: Integration Server displays a notification in Integration Server
Administrator.
- email: Integration Server sends an email to the user.
- none: Integration Server does not notify the user.

Note: If you are using any value other than alert, email, or none, Integration 
Server notifies the user through a notification in Integration Server 
Administrator, followed by an email. By default, the parameter value is blank.

Integration Server restart is not required for changes to these parameters to 
take effect.

In addition, the HybridConnections health indicator is added to track the status
of hybrid connections.
HybridConnections: Checks all the listed tenant connection
aliases and associated accounts for webMethods Cloud. Returns a status of UP if
all of the listed tenant connections and associated accounts are UP.
Returns a status of DOWN if any of the listed tenant or account connections are
down. The health indicator includes individual statuses for tenant connections
and associated accounts, along with the overall hybrid connection status.
If an enabled tenant connection does not have an account alias or the account
alias is not enabled, the health indicator does not list the tenant alias.
If a tenant connection is disabled and the associated account is enabled, the
health indicator shows the account status.

PIE-75952 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Unexpected runtime pipeline if a try-catch construct executes an Exit step
configured to exit $flow and signal failure. 

When using the Try flow step or Sequence step to handle errors, an unexpected
pipeline state occurs when a Loop step is used. Specifically, the pipeline
contains the Loop input array as a scalar variable instead of the original array
when the following series of events occurs: 

- The Try or Sequence step invokes a flow step that contains a child Loop step
- The child Loop step contains an Exit step configured to exit from the $flow
and signal failure 
- The Exit step executes at run time

In the case of a Sequence step or Try step that invokes a flow step containing
the described Loop step, if the child Loop step exits and signals failure, the
pipeline captured by the pub.flow:getLastError service contains the state of the
pipeline in the middle of Loop step execution. The service returns the input
array as a scalar variable rather than the original array. This is a change from
the behavior available in Integration Server versions prior to 10.3 which
returned the original array with the pub.flow:getLastError service. 

In addition to the scenario described above, the Try step exhibits a similar
pipeline corruption issue when the following series of events occurs: 

- The Try step contains a flow step that invokes child Loop step
- The Loop step is configured to exit $flow and signal failure
- The Try step fails at run time.

The resulting pipeline contains a scalar variable instead of the array variable
used for the input array of the Loop step. The pipeline should contain an array
variable for the Loop input array. 
 
With this fix, the dimension of the Loop input array parameter will not change
after the Loop step exits and signals failure. 

PIE-76010 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server ICAP client does not honor the ICAP specification to 
mandatorily encapsulate the whole HTTP request before sending it to the ICAP 
server. Additionally, for a text message that is not a virus, the HTTP status 
code is empty even if the ICAP status is 'ICAP/1.0 200 OK'. Hence, Integration 
Server treats a non-malicious text message as a virus after encapsulating the 
whole HTTP request. 

This issue is now resolved.

Integration Server logs the error message Unable to save event in table.
Details: null. 
 
When the Integration Server is running a very high transaction rate, it is
possible for the following error message to appear: 
 
[ISS.0045.0038E] (tid=<threadID>) Unable to save event in table. Details: null. 
 
When this error occurs, a portion of the statistics data for that 60 second time
interval is lost. 
 
This issue is now resolved. The aforementioned error no longer occurs,
preventing the loss of statistics data. 

PIE-77771 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server throws the following error while connecting to an SFTP 
server: "com.wm.app.b2b.server.sftp.client.SFTPClientException: 
com.sshtools.publickey.InvalidPassphraseException: 
com.maverick.ssh.SshIOException". 

Consider that Integration Server uses the newer SFTP client (version 2) and the 
ED25519 type SSH key pair to connect to an SFTP server. The connection fails 
with SFTPClientException as the maverick-client-1.7.23.jar used by the SFTP 
client lacks support for the ED25519 key signature and SFTP servers that 
support crypto policy. 

This issue is resolved. Applying the fix upgrades the maverick-client-
1.7.23.jar to 1.7.34, which supports the ED25519 key signature. However, the 
upgraded SFTP client does not support authentication keys in the SSH2 format. 
Additionally, the hmac-sha256, hmac-sha256@ssh.com, hmac-sha512, hmac-
sha512@ssh.com, hmac-ripemd160, hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com, hmac-ripemd160-
etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms are not supported. Therefore, for an existing 
server alias, exclude the unsupported MAC algorithms, fetch the host key, and 
save the changes. 

The newer SFTP client (version 2) supports OpenSSH format host keys, and the 
existing key may be in the unsupported SSH2 format. Therefore, testing the 
server alias may throw an error. To avoid the error, regenerate the host key in 
the OpenSSH format, and use the "Get Host Key" button to get the regenerated 
key for the server alias. Similarly, fetch the latest host key if you are 
migrating from an older version of Integration Server, or updating a server 
alias in Integration Server Administrator. 

Once the server alias is successfully created or updated, test whether the user 
alias works with the host key. If testing the user alias results in 
java.security.NoSuchProviderException, add the 
org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider security provider class in 
Integration Server Administrator > Security > Keystore > Add Security Provider.

A URL alias cannot contain a directive reserved for use by Integration Server
such as invoke, wm-message, admin, or rest. Designer might not be able to
connect to Integration Server if a URL alias contains a reserved directive. 
 
Integration Server now performs validation checks that prevent the creation of a
URL alias that uses the reserved directive wm-message. Additionally, Integration
Server provides more logging for the server log and security log when creating
or editing URL alias. 

PIE-78672 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server logs custom fault messages returned by a provider service
in the error log.

When a provider service returns the custom fault messages, Integration Server
logs such custom fault messages in the error log file.

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server introduces the 
watt.server.soap.suppressFaultAsError server configuration parameter that helps 
control whether custom fault messages are logged or not.
 
watt.server.soap.suppressFaultAsError - Set to true to prevent Integration 
Server from logging the custom fault messages in the error log. Set to false to 
log custom fault messages as errors. The default value is false.
 
If you update the parameter value, you need not restart Integration Server for 
the changes to take effect.
 
Note: Although Integration Server suppresses custom log messages when the 
parameter is true, the service error count on the Statistics page in 
Integration Server Administrator includes the custom fault messages.

Swagger specification does not support minimum and maximum values 
for date and time variables. Hence, Integration Server fails to 
create a RAD based on Swagger specification and a REST resource 
that references a service signature with date or time variables 
having minimum and maximum values. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server ignores the minimum 
and maximum values for date and time variables while creating the RAD.

channel, where the content type is "Multipart/related". 

The new content handler introduced in Integration Server 10.15 processes 
requests only when the content type is "application/vnd.softwareag.json+binary" 
and throws an unsupported type validation error for any other content type. 
Hence, Integration Server throws "500 service error" for requests using an 
RNIF channel with the "Multipart/related" content type. Additionally, the lack 
of support for other content types causes incompatibility issues with previous 
versions of the Integration Server. 

This issue is resolved. Now, the content types that are not supported are 
assigned to the default content handler (ContentHandler_Default), which treats 
the content as text/html.

PIE-79758 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Addition of classes to the whitelist classes file for Integration Server.

Integration Server includes a whitelist of the classes that can be loaded and
deserialized in Integration Server. The following classes have been added to the
whitelist maintained by Integration Server: 

java.io.IOException
java.io.StreamCorruptedException
java.net.UnknownHostException
java.io.FileNotFoundException
java.net.ConnectException
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException
wm.cds.integration.ISSessionManager$1
com.wm.net.ftpCException

PIE-79765 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Creating a consumer REST API Descriptor (RAD) from a Swagger document 
generates a connector service that returns an empty response body.

When you create a consumer RAD in Integration Server 
from a Swagger document that has a default response object, Integration
Server does not create a document from the default response object 
schema in the output of the generated connector service. 
Additionally, if you run the connector service, and the output 
has a response code that is not defined as a response object 
in the Swagger document, the response body is empty.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server returns a document 
generated from the default response object schema at runtime.

PIE-79776 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
The watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity server configuration parameter
is not visible on the Extended Settings page and of Integration Server
Administrator. 

The change to address issue PIE-71548, which prevents a potential thread
deadlock scenario in receiving and processing expired access token
notifications, added the new configuration parameter
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity. A description of the configuration
parameter was not included in the fix readme and is not visible on the Extended
Settings page of Integration Server Administrator. 

Now, watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity appears on the Extended
Settings page. A description of the parameter is below. 

watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity
Specifies the maximum capacity of the queue that Integration Server uses to
handle expired access tokens. When the queue reaches capacity, Integration
Server blocks threads attempting to put more access tokens into the queue. This
prevents the queue from growing too large and creating memory pressure when
Integration Server is under very high load. The default value is 10000. 

You must restart Integration Server for changes to
watt.server.oauth.tokenRemoval.queueCapacity to take effect. 

PIE-79820 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
The status of service invocation from Designer is unknown as the result is
empty. 

When "watt.server.http.returnException" is set to false, Integration Server 
returns an empty result on the failure of service invocation from Designer.
Hence, users do not know whether the service failed or succeeded. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server returns an error message 
instead of an empty result when a service fails.

PIE-79907 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server rejects an Id Token with an acr value if the
acr_values_supported field is not in an OpenID provider's configuration. 

The acr_values_supported field is not required in an OpenID provider's
configuration. When it is not present and the provider presents an Id Token with
an acr value, Integration Server incorrectly rejects the Id Token with an error
indicating the acr value is invalid. 

This has been resolved. When an OpenID provider's configuration does not include
an acr_values_supported field, the acr field in the provider's Id Token may
contain any string value. 

PIE-80050 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
The "pub.string:substitutePipelineVariables" service does not substitute a 
variable with its value. 

While using the "pub.string:substitutePipelineVariables" service, if the 
'inString' input parameter takes a document array pipeline variable (for 
example, %doc[0]/name%) as the value, the service does not substitute the 
variable with its corresponding value. 

The issue is now resolved.

PIE-80110 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
An OpenAPI request with a oneOf constraint fails. 

Integration Server fails to parse the valid payload of an OpenAPI 
request when an optional element in the request is validated 
against a oneOf constraint. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-80157 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
Responses from Integration server are not completely HTML-encoded. 

Integration Server must return HTML-encoded entities corresponding to all 
characters, including (< > " ' )  in the responses. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-80350 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
The pub.security services that accept a secret-key passphrase as an input 
succeed despite providing an incorrect value. 

This issue is resolved. Now, the pub.security services throw an exception for 
an incorrect secret-key passphrase.

PIE-80604 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix3)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-75416, the session timeout for the
session created when a user logs in to Integration Server is hardcoded to 600000
milliseconds instead of using the value of the watt.server.clientTimeout server
configuration parameter. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-72764 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
When extracting claim details from a JWT, the output does not match the service
signature.

When extracting claim details from a JWT using the pub.jwt:extractClaimsFromJWT 
public service, the "claimsDetails" output parameter is a Document, which is
incorrect as "claimsDetails" is a Document List in the service signature.

This issue is resolved.

PIE-73638 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
When the connection between Integration Server and the LDAP server is unstable, 
logging in to Integration Server fails intermittently with the "Unable to open 
a connection to ldap" error. 

The issue is resolved.  Now, the com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.timeout and 
com.sun.jndi.ldap.read.timeout properties are set while creating the LDAP 
context, which prevents intermittent connection failures. The default value for 
both properties is 30 seconds. Alternatively, a user can set these properties
through the watt.server.ldap.extendedProps server configuration parameter.

PIE-74826 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
The Auto Package Deployer system task in Integration Server fails to 
automatically deploy updated packages to a server.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76115 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server throws "425 Unable to build data connection: TLS session of 
data connection not resumed." while executing pub.client.ftp:ls. 

Integration Server does not honor the 
watt.security.ssl.resumeClientSessions server configuration parameter. 
Hence, the pub.client.ftp:ls service fails to build a data connection. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-76249 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server sends an invalid SOAP response to the client while returning 
data with an invalid character. 

Integration Server sends two SOAP envelopes to the client while returning data 
with an invalid character from a web service provider. This behavior is 
incorrect. The response from Integration Server must contain a single envelope 
with the error. 

This issue is resolved.

PIE-76253 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
JVM statistics are missing from the Dashboard in Integration Server
Administrator. 

Depending on the Java version and fix level, some JVM statistics were missing
from the Dashboard because Integration Server did not collect them. 

Integration Server now collects JVM statistics regardless of JVM version and fix
level, preventing missing JVM statistics in the Dashboard. 

PIE-77042 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Debugging an OpenAPI connector service returns an incorrect response.

While executing a connector service generated from an OpenAPI 
document, the service execution sends the REST request to 
the provider and returns the correct response. However, if 
you run the connector service in the debug mode in Designer, 
the service execution does not send the request to the 
REST provider and returns an incorrect response.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77076 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server returns incorrect output for a mapping service with 
two variables of the same name but different types. 

Consider a flow service with a map step that maps a pipeline input to a variable
of the Document List type. The flow service has another 
variable of the same name but of type Document. In such scenarios, Integration
Server performs an incorrect mapping at runtime, which results in data loss. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77199 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Saving a flow service returns the Java heap space error. 

Consider a new Document Type created from an XML schema. On  
saving a flow service that has a map step with the Document Type, 
Integration Server returns the Java heap space error. However, the 
issue only occurs if the flow service containing the Document Type 
is created and saved before restarting Integration Server. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77408 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
The "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID" service causes 
performance degradation in databases while deleting large data sets.

Integration Server uses wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID to 
remove the expired entries from the WM_IDR_MSG_HST table. 
However, in some databases, wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID degrades the
database performance while deleting large data sets. 

This issue is resolved.

Now, Integration Server provides an option to remove the expired 
entries in batches and to configure the batch size. To limit the batch size, 
use the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit server configuration
parameter. 

If you set the parameter value to a positive integer, Integration Server uses
the value to apply a batching logic to remove the entries. If you do not provide 
any value, Integration Server retains the old behavior. There is no default value 
for the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit parameter. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-77486 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Rhino JAR is upgraded from version 1.7.7.1 to 1.7.14 to resolve
security vulnerabilities.

PIE-77687 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Designer exhibits slow response time while deleting, renaming, and copying 
elements when the Integration Server namespace contains REST resources 
and REST API descriptors.

After applying this fix, Integration Server shows an improvement in 
the amount of time required to delete, rename, and copy elements when 
REST resources and REST API descriptors are present.

PIE-77819 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
In an Integration Server setup with API Gateway, when NTLM authentication is 
enabled for a native service, Integration Server throws the "Exception during 
NTLM handshake : Socket input is already shutdown" error endlessly if any 
exception occurs during an NTLM handshake. 

The issue is resolved. Now, if there is an NTLM handshake exception, 
Integration Server returns the same exception to the caller.

PIE-78012 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
The temporary zip file created by the diagnostics utility is not deleted
automatically after it is downloaded. 

When the diagnostic utility executes, the utility generates a temporary archive
(zip file) in the directory Integration Server_directory
\instances\<instance_name>\logs and then downloads the file. The temporary
archive is not deleted after it is downloaded. Each time the diagnostic utility
runs, it generates a new diagnostic archive. Leaving the temporary archives
could exhaust disk space. 

Now, after the diagnostic utility creates and downloads diagnostic archive, the
utility deletes the temporary archive from Integration Server_directory
\instances\<instance_name>\logs directory. 

PIE-78021 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Event Manager subscriptions do not work properly when
watt.server.idatacoder.legacy is set to false. 

The value of the server configuration parameter watt.server.idatacoder.legacy
determines whether Integration Server uses the current version or the legacy
version of the IDataBinCoder for encoding documents using the binary protocol. A
value of true indicates the legacy version is used; false (the default value)
indicates the new version is used. However, when the parameter is set to false,
using Event Manager to add a subscription for an event type results in the
unwanted replication of the subscription for other event types. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-78028 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
The pub.packages services display an incorrect error message
when the "package" input parameter is empty. 

When the package input parameter is empty, Integration Server
displays error messages containing "packageName" instead of "package"
for all "pub.packages" services.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78037 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
A dateTime string does not pass validation by pub.schema:validate but should.

All valid lexical representations of the XML Schema data type dateTime should
pass XML validation. However, the pub.schema:validate service incorrectly flags
some lexical representations of dateTime as invalid when milliseconds are
included. Specifically, a dateTime value that includes 24:00:00 as the time
fails validation if the seconds fragment included milliseconds. That is, the
pub.schema:validate service treats a time value of 24:00:00 as valid but treats
24:00:00.000 as invalid. This is incorrect. 

Now, all valid datetime representations that include milliseconds will pass
validation. 

PIE-78127 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
When the watt.server.httplog value is changed and the http log file rotates
prior to Integration Server restart, the rotated file is empty. 

This has been resolved. The http log now rotates successfully after the value of
watt.server.httplog is changed. 

PIE-78132 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Introspection requests are sent to an external authorization server fail if the
server log facility 10 OAuth level is Debug or a more verbose level. 

When the server log facility 10 OAuth is set to the Debug level or a more
verbose level, OAuth authorization requests sent to the introspection endpoint
on an external authorization server fail. The failure is due to inadvertent
modification of the password value in the request body when logging for the
OAuth facility is set to the Debug level or a more verbose level. 

This issue has been corrected.

PIE-78156 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-72193, exceptions are missing from the
logs displayed in Designer. 

When Designer is used to invoke the internal service
wm.server.packages:getDependenciesList and an invalid package name is specified,
the Results tab does not display exceptions. 

Now, Designer shows exception details when the internal service
wm.server.packages:getDependenciesList is invoked with an invalid package name. 

PIE-78256 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
During Integration Server migration from 10.5 to 10.11, the migration utility 
throws "java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException" for files at random while 
copying packages to the target instance. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78374 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Rollback of a message received by a webMethods messaging trigger 
results in excessive logging at the Info level in the server log.

When Integration Server rolls back a message received by a 
webMethods messaging trigger to Universal Messaging, Integration 
Server writes all the rollback details at the Info logging level 
instead of the Debug level.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server writes the log messages 
for rollback of a message when the facility 0153 dispatcher 
(Universal Messaging) is set to Debug or a more verbose level.

PIE-78417 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
After applying a fix that included PIE-72514, deployment sometimes fails with an
exception about deletion of artifacts. 

The solution for PIE-72514 introduced new logic for copying Deployer artifacts
into an Integration Sever installation. However, some of the streams used for
file copy operations were not properly closed, resulting in failed deployments
and an exception like the following: 

Exception: [ISS.0088.9112] An Exception was thrown in the server:[ISS.0085.9345]
Deletion of artifacts delivered for deployment ID <deployment_ID> failed with an
exception. For more information, see the Integration Server logs. 

This issue now fixed. Streams for file copy operations are now properly closed.

PIE-78563 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server Administrator indicates that CORS-related server
configuration parameters need a restart when the value is changed but they do
not. 

The following server configuration parameters do not need a restart for a new
value to take effect, but Integration Server erroneously indicated that a
restart is required: 

- watt.server.cors.allowedOrigins
- watt.server.cors.enabled
- watt.server.cors.exposedHeaders
- watt.server.cors.maxAge
- watt.server.cors.supportedHeaders
- watt.server.cors.supportedMethods
- watt.server.cors.supportsCredentials
 
This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78564 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
A request to log into Integration Server via the Integration Server
Administrator API results in a response with an extra Set-Cookie headers. 

The response to a log in request sent via the Integration Server Administrator
API contains two Set-Cookie headers. One Set-Cookie header holds a null ssnid
attribute. The other Set-Cookie header contains the ssnid attribute set to the
actual session ID. 

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server no longer includes the Set-Cookie
header with a null ssnid in the response to a login request. 

PIE-78654 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Multiple sessions on Integration Server are established for a user login, which
can result in an invalid session count. 

For each user log in to Integration Server Integration Server or Integration
Server Administrator, one session is established for accessing the log in page
(this session has a user ID of local/default) and another is established when
user is authenticated (this session has a user ID of local/Administrator).
However, the initial session is not killed when the second session is
established. This results in an invalid session count. Additionally, the initial
session for the local/default users consumes a licensed session. 

Now, once the user is authenticated, Integration Server kills the initial
session for the local/default user that was created when the Integration Server
log in page was accessed. 

PIE-78669 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-72661, password retrieval incorrectly 
used global password managers instead of package-level password managers. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-78721 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
The pub.json:documentToJSONString service incorrectly converts a 
date object using the local time zone. 

While converting a date object with 'encodeDateAs' set to 'ISO8601', 
the pub.json:documentToJSONString service considers the local time 
zone instead of the Zulu time zone or UTC, resulting in a time difference. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78746 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server incorrectly displays Unicode characters in the 
response to an OpenAPI service request.

For a service request from an OpenAPI client, Integration Server does 
not use the UTF-8 encoding for Unicode characters in the response. 
Hence, the characters are incorrectly displayed.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78780 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Updates to metering service list. 

PIE-78801 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
The error log contains a misleading reference to the
wm.client.integrationlive.account:sendEdgeStatusToCloud service and the
webMethods Messaging subsystem. 

When an Integration Server is not licensed for publish/subscribe capabilities,
Integration Server writes the following message to the server log at start up: 

[ISS.0153.9012] The webMethods Messaging subsystem was not initialized. No
webMethods Messaging features are available. See server log for more details. 

However, the error log also lists the above message and associates it with the
service the wm.client.integrationlive.account:sendEdgeStatusToCloud service.
This behavior is incorrect and may cause confusion. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78934 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Universal Messaging connection alias that uses basic authentication does not
work when password was supplied via a configuration variables template. 

When a configuration variables template (application.properties file) is used to
set the password for a Universal Messaging connection alias that uses basic
authentication, Integration Server saves the password in the outbound password
store with an incorrect handle. This results in an unusable password and Universal
Messaging connection aliases that cannot establish a connection. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-79102 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
The server logger resets to the default INFO logging level after 
Integration Server restart.

If you set the logging level for server logger using Integration Server 
Administrator while multiple log4j files are configured for layered

changes to the default INFO level after a restart. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-79135 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server fails to process a request URL that includes a URL alias.

Integration Server does not resolve a request URL that includes a URL alias
similar to other URL aliases. For example, if the following URL aliases exist,
Integration Server cannot resolve a request URL that includes one of the
aliases:
a/b
a/b/c
a/b/d

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-79159 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server fails to get a connection from the JDBC connection pool 
after editing the pool alias. 

When the Spy Diagnostics feature is enabled and the database URL uses an 
SQLServer URL with instanceName instead of the port , editing the JDBC connection 
pool alias from Integration Server Administrator adds a space to the spyParms 
attribute in the pool configuration file (alias.xml). As a result, Integration 
Server fails to get a connection from the connection pool. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-79208 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-75533, the pub.client:http service fails

PIE-79408 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
When applying a configuration variables template, Microservices Runtime ignores
the value of the messaging.<connectionAliasName>.default property and instead

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-79489 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix2)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-75533, calls to an endpoint may take 
up to 10 seconds longer as the changes due to the fix invoke the

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server calls the socket.getRemoteAddress() 
method instead of the socket.getInetAddress().getHostName() method.

PIE-74874 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
When Integration Server streams files larger than 50 MB using MTOM/XOP and uses

PIE-75822 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
If the Global IP Threat Protection Policy (TPP) denies a request sent
to the configured API through API Gateway external port, the subsequent
requests do not work.

With the TPP configured in API Gateway, when you send a request through
the API Gateway external port, the TPP denies the request if any rule
violations are identified, resulting in the HTTP 403 status code. Any
subsequent request also results in an HTTP 401 status code with the
"Invalid Session ID" message, which is an incorrect behavior.

The issue is due to not cleaning up the session and cookie IDs when
there is a rule violation.

This issue is resolved. Now, subsequent requests are successful.

PIE-76676 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server does not support OAuth token authentication for POP3 email

Integration Server does not restart the JMS triggers that fail during
the trigger registration process.

Integration Server does not attempt to restart the triggers that fail

disabled unless enabled manually.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server restarts the 
failed triggers that fail during the trigger registration process unless 
the failure is due to configuration issues.

PIE-76895 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
For HTTP requests that return the 401 response code, the pub.client:http 
service sends another request if a cookie header is used for authentication in 
the HTTP request. 

The issue is resolved now. The watt.net.http401.retryWithoutCookie server 
configuration parameter is introduced. Set the parameter to false to prevent 
the pub.client:http service from sending a duplicate request. The default value 
is true, which retains the old behavior. You do not need to restart Integration 
Server for the changes to take effect.

PIE-77209 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server does not start if an unrecognized class is persisted in
eventcfg.bin. 

If an unrecognized class is persisted in eventcfg.bin, Event Manager cannot
deserialize it during initialization. This prevents Integration Server from
starting. 

This is now fixed. When reading the eventcfg.bin, Integration Server logs an
error for each error that it encounters. This allows Integration Server to
proceed with startup. 

PIE-77728 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
File handles remain open even after the pub.io:streamToString service execution
completes. 

When you provide a file stream to inputStream of the pub.io:streamToString

PIE-78255 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
The migrate.cnf migration settings file has an error in the record name.

In the migrate.cnf file, the record name has an underscore, which is incorrect.

<record name="IS_CustomWrapperMigrator" javaclass="com.wm.util.Values">
    <value name="isSelected">false</value>
</record>

The issue is resolved. Now, the underscore in the record name is removed.

PIE-78318 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
When Integration Server starts up, a critical message and an error message about
indexFileDir appear in the console. 

Integration Server writes the following messages to the console during start up:

[ISS.0045.0045C] (tid=###) Failed to create or append index. Details:
'indexFileDir' must be declared before an index may be opened. 

[ISS.0030.0013E] (tid=###) An exception was encountered while processing an
administrative request. See the error log for details: [ISS.0030.0385] Search
request failed. Details: [ISS.0045.0045] Failed to create or append index.
Details: 'indexFileDir' must be declared before an index may be opened. 

These messages occur because the Statistics Data Collector, which gathers and
returns metrics for the Dashboard, has not yet completed startup. 

This issue is now resolved. The error message ISS.0030.0013 will no longer
appear during startup. The Critical level message ISS.0045.0045 is now logged at
the Debug level. 

PIE-78321 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
When strict service caching is in use, Integration Server does not merge the
cached results into the pipeline. 

When strict service caching is enabled
(watt.server.serviceResults.cache.strict=true), Integration Server should merge
the output values cached for the declared output signature into the calling
service pipeline. However, Integration Server does not merge the cached values
into the pipeline and instead returns only the cached values. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-78331 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
After changing the pool alias used by the ISDashboardStats function, Integration
Server Administrator exhibits a delay before all of the data on the Services tab
in the Dashboard is updated. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-78392 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
Service invoked via com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient fails if
watt.server.http.jsonFormat is set to stream or bytes. 

When the server configuration parameter watt.server.http.jsonFormat is set to
stream or bytes, the body of a request sent from
com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient to Integration Server is not parsed into a
pipeline. Invocation of the requested services fails because expected variables
are not present in the input pipeline. 

To resolve this issue, Integration Server adds the "User-agent: webMethods"
header to each request sent from com.wm.app.b2b.client.JSONClient. The header
instructs Integration Server to parse the JSON, regardless of the
watt.server.http.jsonFormat setting. 

PIE-78418 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
The pub.client.ftp:login service throws a NullPointerException while using the
FTPS protocol in the implicit mode. 

Implicit FTPS is deprecated and Integration Server does not support the FTPS
protocol in the implicit mode. Hence, the service returns a 
NullPointerException. 

The issue is now resolved. The NullPointerException is now replaced with the
"Implicit FTPS is not supported." message. 

PIE-78618 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
The command line administrator tool cannot retrieve online help for webMethods
products that use package ClassLoaders. 

webMethods products can use their own package ClassLoaders to expose an API
though the Integration Server Administrator API framework. When this happens,
wmisa (the command line administrator tool) cannot retrieve online help for the
product. 

This fix changes the Integration Server Administrator API framework so that
online help for all webMethods administrator APIs can be viewed with the command
line tool. 

Note that wmisa, the command line client for administering Integration Server,
is an unsupported utility that can be installed from
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@softwareag/wmisa. 

PIE-78729 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
An attempt to query the Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator before the
Statistics Data Collector completes start up may result in errors. 

If the Dashboard is queried prior to the Statistics Data Collector completing
its startup, the following error messages may appear in the Dashboard: 

- ISAdmin -> updateFunctionalAlias - refreshedFailFastMode on function
ISDashboardStats to false. 
- Failed to create or append index. Details: 'indexFileDir' must be declared
before an index may be opened. 

After the Statistics Data Collector completes startup, the messages no longer
appear and the Dashboard is updated as expected. 

In addition to resolution of the above issue, facility 45 Statistics Data
Collector no longer produces Critical level messages because statistics data
collection is not critical to the function of Integration Server. Instead, these
messages are logged at the error level. 

PIE-78758 (IS_10.15_Core_Fix1)
When Integration Server writes log messages to the console, the console contains
unexpected log message about the ISDashboardStats function on start up. 

When Integration Server starts up, messages that include the following text
might appear in the console: 

ISAdmin -> updateFunctionalAlias - refreshedFailFastMode on function
ISDashboardStats to false 

These messages appear during start up of the Statistics Data Collector which
collects metrics for display in the Dashboard of Integration Server
Administrator. 

With this fix, Integration Server no longer writes these messages to the console
at start up.
