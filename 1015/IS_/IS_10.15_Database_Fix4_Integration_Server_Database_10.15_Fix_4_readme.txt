PIE-86110
Primary and foreign key columns in data statics tables for SQL Server should use
the data type BIGINT instead of INTEGER. 

When installing the Integration Server database schema for SQL Server,
installation created primary and foreign keys for the following tables using the
INTEGER data type: IS_MONITOR, IS_SERVER_DETAILS, IS_SERVER_STATS and
IS_SERVICE_STATS. The primary and foreign key columns should be of type BIGINT. 

This issue is now resolved. After applying this fix, the data type for primary
and foreign key columns in the mentioned tables will be BIGINT. Existing data
will be preserved. 

PIE-87571
Table indices created in the wrong tablespace when installing Integration Server
database schema for Oracle. 

When installing Integration Server database schema for Oracle, the following
tables indices were created in WEBMDATA instead of WEBINDX tablespace:
IS_MONITOR, IS_SERVER_DETAILS, IS_SERVER_STATS, IS_SERVICE_STATS and IS_ALERT 

This issue has been corrected. After applying this fix, newly indexed data will
be written to the WEBMINDX tablespace. Any existing index data will be rebuilt
in the WEBINDX tablespace as well. 

PIE-92751
Internal change to support Embedded Derby fixes.

PIE-94643
Internal changes to support OAuth usage by layered products.  

PIE-86011 (IS_10.15_Database_Fix3)
Migrating the Archive component in Integration Server from a lower version
to a higher version results in the error: "Cannot drop the trigger 'WMSERVICE_RAIU',
because it does not exist"

This issue is now resolved.

WDA-1908
In webMethods Monitor, a lock in the WMSERVICE_RAIU trigger causes performance issues.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8101
When webMethods Monitor uses a Microsoft SQL Server database and there is a race
condition during services execution, an error message appears in the server.log
file: 
"Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.WMSERVICE_MIN_MAX' with unique
index 'IDX_SVC_MINMAX_CTX'." 

The issue is resolved.

PIE-77408 (IS_10.15_Database_Fix1)
The "wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID" service causes 
performance degradation in databases while deleting large data sets.

Integration Server uses wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID to 
remove the expired entries from the WM_IDR_MSG_HST table. 
However, in some databases, wm.server.dispatcher:deleteExpiredUUID degrades the
database performance while deleting large data sets. 

This issue is resolved.

Now, Integration Server provides an option to remove the expired 
entries in batches and to configure the batch size. To limit the batch size, 
use the watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit server configuration
parameter. 

If you set the parameter value to a positive integer, Integration Server uses the value 
to apply a batching logic to remove the entries. If you do not provide any value,
Integration Server retains the old behavior. There is no default value for the
watt.server.trigger.delete.expired.uuid.limit parameter. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-78146 (IS_10.15_Database_Fix1)
When using a SQL Server database, the pub.storage:get service occasionally
encounters a deadlock error. 

The distributed locking table WM_EXCL_DIST_LOCK has a redundant unique index on
its primary key. The unique index is not needed as primary keys are inherently
unique. Presence of the redundant index increases the likelihood that a deadlock
error will occur. 

To resolve this issue, a database migration script has been added to drop the
redundant index. 

PIE-78575 (IS_10.15_Database_Fix1)
After installing IS_10.15_Database_Fix1 on Integration Server 10.15, database
migration throws an error.

After installing the latest database fix (IS_10.15_Database_Fix1) on Integration
Server, migrating the database from 10.11.fix2 to the latest fix version results in the
"path not found for 10.11.fix2 MYSQL to latest" error as the folder required to
migrate the ISInternal component to the latest version is missing.

This issue is now resolved.
