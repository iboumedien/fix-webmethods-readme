DTS-3353
Disable autocomplete for the Integration Server Administrator login page.

Autocomplete is now disabled for the form fields Username and Password on the
Integration Server Administrator login page. However, browsers might still have
autocomplete enabled, resulting in the browser prompting users to save username
and password. For information about disabling autocomplete or autofill for a
browser, refer to the browser documentation. 

DTS-3433
Integration Server Administrator is not legible when using a browser that uses a
dark theme. 

Integration Server Administrator only supports the light theme for a browser.
However, Integration Server should be legible and display correctly in a browser
that uses the dark theme. 

Integration Server Administrator now renders properly in a browser that uses the
dark theme. 

PIE-99687
Creating a JKS keystore alias with multiple key aliases using the
/admin/keystore API causes the error
[ISS.0139.9071] Error: cannot load the keystore pointed to by keystore alias.

When you invoke the /admin/keystore API to create a JKS keystore alias with
multiple key aliases, Integration Server creates the keystore alias but with the
error. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-3302 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix10)
Integration Server Administrator uses a date/time calendar component from a
third-party library that is no longer maintained. 

Prior to this fix, Integration Server Administrator used the
bootstrap-daterangepicker library for selecting dates. However, this library is
no longer maintained which creates a security risk. 

Integration Sever Administrator now use the ngx-daterangepicker-material
library. 

This resolves the following security vulnerability: CVE 2022-31129

This fix also removes the third-party moment-duration-format library which is no
longer maintained. 

DTS-3341 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix10)
Some HTML elements in Integration Server Administrator did not have an
aria-label attribute. 

The aria-label attribute has now been added.

DTS-3352 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix10)
On the Services tab of the Dashboard, the Services Instances tab does not reload
after switching to another tab and then switching back. 

This issue is now resolved. 

DTS-3264 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix9)
Integration Server returns details from an internal file without requiring
authentication. 

A call to <host>:<port>/assets/version.properties returns internal details from
the version.properties file without requiring authentication. 

This issue is resolved. Now, accessing the file requires administrator
credentials. 

PIE-95921 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix9)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-87732, the number of running services
displayed on the Dashboard includes SOAP services that executed to completion. 

Now, Integration Server properly decrements the number of running services for
SOAP services. 

PIE-96927 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix9)
A request to GET /admin/package/{packageName} returns a 400 instead of a 404
when the requested package is not found on Integration Server. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-3226 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix8)
Integration Server Administrator displays a message about a missing WmGRPC
package even though the package is not installed and is not required. 

The WmGRPC package provides support for using gRPC with Integration Server. The
package is not required. However, when the WmGRPC package is not installed,
Integration Server Administrator displays the following message: 

[ISS.0030.0013E] (tid=<threadID>) An exception was encountered while processing
an administrative request. See the error log for details: Unknown package WmGRPC 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-3228 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix8)
The Current sessions dialog displayed the incorrect value for Connect time.

The Current sessions dialog displayed a Connect time value that divided the
connect time, which is received as seconds, by 1000. As the connect time is
received in seconds, not milliseconds, this division was not necessary. 

This issue is resolved.

Note: In the Dashboard > Usages tab, the Current sessions dialog can be accessed
via the Sessions summary table by clicking the number in the Current column for
the Total sessions row. 

DTS-3238 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix8)
Resolution for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in /ssologout endpoint.

The /ssologout endpoint is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing
malicious actors to inject JavaScript code via the redirectURL query parameter
into a web page. 

This vulnerability is fixed and the redirectURL is sanitized.

PIE-94652 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix8)
Integration Server (IS) exposes the internal IS version details without 
authentication.

Integration Server exposes the internal IS version details maintained in the 
version.properties file without authentication through 
host:port/assets/version.properties.

This issue is resolved. Now, the file requires administrator credentials for 
access.

DTS-3131 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix7)
When killing a session in using the Dashboard > Usages > Current Sessions page
in Integration Server Administrator, the session ID was exposed in the URL of
the call to Integration Server. 

To make the request for a killing a session more secure, Integration Server
includes the session ID in the body of the request and not the URL. 

DTS-3149 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix7)
When hovering the cursor over a long server log entry in Integration Server
Administrator, tooltip text appears outside of the tooltip text frame boundary. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-87732 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix7)
Dashboard displays incorrect metrics for SOAP API service invocations.

The Services and APIs tabs in the Integration Server Administrator Dashboard do
not always display the correct metrics for services invoked for a SOAP API.
Sometimes, a service invocation counted as a failure even though the service
invocation succeeded. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2814 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix6)
Integration Server Administrator uses the browser's local storage to store 
preferences for individual users and leverages usernames to access an 
individual's preferences. This poses a security risk.

The issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server Administrator no longer stores 
preferences for multiple users within individual browsers, and usernames are no 
longer stored in the browser's local storage.

DTS-2839 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix6)
Corrections to server log display in Integration Server Administrator.

The following issues in the Server > Logs > Server page in Integration Server 
Administrator have been fixed:

- The First line to display list accepts zero (0) as the value and uses 0 as the 
default. The default (and minimum value) is now 1.
- Entering a value larger than 65535 in the field Number of entries to display,
results in Integration Server writing the following error to the server log, 
possibly multiple times: [ISS.0035.0004E] (tid=<threadID>) Returned 65,535 lines 
while requested for 500,000 number of lines for error logs." Now, values greater 
than 65,535 are not accepted.
- After a refresh interval is set, the logs are not aligned.
- When the dual vertical scroll bars appear, the tooltip text for lengthy logs 
may stretch beyond the tooltip borders.

DTS-2889 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix6)
Non-administrator users cannot log into API Gateway after watt.server.defaultPackage 
is set to WmRoot.

After the watt.server.defaultPackage server configuration parameter is set to 
WmRoot and Integration Server is restarted, a user that does not have 
Administrator access to API Gateway can no longer log in.

This issue is now resolved.

Note: Only members of the Administrators ACL can log into Integration Server 
Administrator. This restriction does not apply to API Gateway.

DTS-2900 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix6)
By default, Integration Server Administrator displays Server log entries in
ascending order starting with the earliest log entry.

Log entries in the Logs > Server page are sorted by line number, beginning with
the lowest number representing the earliest log entry. This causes the most
recent log entries to appear at the end.

The Logs > Server page now displays server log entries in descending order,
beginning with the most recent entry. Click the Server Log Entry column name to
change the sorting.

PIE-84441 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix5)
The /metrics endpoint returns multiple instances of the metrics
sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis and sag_is_service_requests_total with
different timestamps. 

Now, the /metrics endpoint returns only a single instance of the
sag_is_service_requests_avg_exec_millis and sag_is_service_requests_total
metrics for each IS service. 

Additionally, JVM and server metrics are now based on current data at the time
the /metrics endpoint is called.  In the past, JVM and server metrics were based
on aggregated data that could be several minutes old. 

PIE-84960 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix5)
The sag_is_server_total_memory_mbytes and sag_is_server_used_memory_mbytes
metrics incorrectly reported values for the Integration Server JVM heap memory
instead of the operating system memory. 

Now, these metrics measure operating system memory.

PIE-85586 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix5)
Session IDs are not masked in a response to a request made by a member of the
ReadOnlyAdministrators group. 

Members of the ReadOnlyAdministrators group have read-only access to the
Integration Server Administrator API. However, a response for a request for
session information returned an unmasked session ID. 

Now, Session IDs are masked (******) in responses to requests submitted by
members of the ReadOnlyAdministrators group. 

DTS-2515 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix5)
In Integration Server Administrator > Logs > Server, the incomplete horizontal
scroll prevents the user from fully viewing the server logs.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2532 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix5)
The Dashboard and server logs show erroneous error messages when the Statistics
Data Collector is disabled. 

The Statistics Data Collector gathers metrics displayed in the Dashboard in
Integration Server Administrator. When the Statistics Data Collector is
intentionally disabled, Integration Server Administrator and the server log
display error messages indicating it is disabled. For example, the server log
contains: 

[ISS.0030.0013E] (tid=###) An exception was encountered while processing an
administrative request. See the error log for details: [ISS.0030.0385] Search
request failed. Details: DISABLED 

Integration Server Administrator displays: [ISS.0030.0385] Search request
failed. Details: DISABLED 

These errors should not be logged or displayed when the Statistics Data
Collector is intentionally disabled. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2585 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix5)
The Statistics Data Collector incorrectly excludes some metrics data in the REST
resources used in Integration Service Administrator dashboard.

This issue is now resolved.

The Exclude system services check box is now removed from the Integration Server
Administrators' Dashboard APIs page, resulting in displaying all the data
returned by the REST service call.

DTS-2599 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix5)
The Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator shows Cluster status is Off
even when the status is On, if Statistics Data Collection is disabled in
Dashboard configuration.

This issue is now resolved. The Cluster Status is displayed as Unknown and a
message that the statistics data collection is disabled appears if the
Statistics Data Collection is disabled.

PIE-82499 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix4)
The Integration Server Administrator APIs for the alert resource should use the
POST method instead of PUT for administrative actions. 

The following operations for the alert resource are now deprecated and will not
appear in the OpenAPI (Swagger) document for the Administrator API. 

PUT /admin/alert
PUT /admin/alert/id/{id}
PUT /admin/alert/notifier/{name}

The operations listed above are now supported as:

POST /admin/alert
POST /admin/alert/id/{id}
POST /admin/alert/notifier/{name}

PIE-83320 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix4)
Integration Server fails to accept a number with a unit of measurement 
(KB, MB, or GB) for the watt.server.http.interceptor.preprocess.sizeLimit 
server configuration parameter using the new Integration Server Administrator.

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-83641 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix4)
During Integration Server startup, the Statistics Data Collector skips
collection of some OS and Integration Server data. 

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-84373 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix4)
Overview tab in Integration Server Administrator Dashboard does not display any
data but does display a NumberFormatException alert. 

This issue is resolved.

PIE-84389 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix4)
Statistics Data Collector incorrectly excludes some statistics for REST APIs.

When the Exclude system services check box is selected on the APIs page of the
Dashboard in Integration Server Administrator, the REST API metrics incorrectly
excludes data from automatically generated services. The Exclude system services
check box was intended to exclude metrics data produced by a service in Wm*
system package. However, the Statistics Data Collector treats services generated
automatically when creating assets in Designer as system services. 

To address this issue, the Statistics Data Collector no longer excludes services
from its metrics gathering for REST APIs. 

Note: This is the server side change for DTS-2588 which removes the Exclude
system services check box. 

PIE-84568 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix4)
Updates to internal resources in the Integration Server Administrator API to
support the Dashboard. 

DTS-2468 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
In the Services page of Monitoring, clicking the Edit pipeline button of a
service that is deployed on another Integration Server results in an error and
an empty Edit pipeline dialog box. 

The issue is resolved.

DTS-2516 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
In Monitoring, the Edit pipeline dialog for a service shows empty service
inputs.

In Integration Server Administrator > Monitoring, the Edit pipeline dialog for
a service does not display service inputs if the field names or a document name
in the fields' hierarchy has one or more dots.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81502 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
The keystore and truststore resources cannot be reloaded using the 
administrator APIs as they do not have the reload action. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2153 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
Integration Server Administrator slows down when Integration Server receives
numerous notifications.

This issue is resolved. Integration Server now receives a maximum of 500
notifications.

DTS-2321 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
When Integration Server Administrator is idle for a period of time, the session
timeout notification appears. Clicking the "Stay logged in" in the session
timeout notification fails to keep the user logged in.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-82415 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
Updated moment.js library in Integration Server Administrator.

Integration Server Administrator uses the moment.js library to handle dates and
times. However, the moment.js library version 2.26.0 included in Integration
Server Administrator has known security vulnerabilities.

Now, Integration Server Administrator includes moment.js version 2.29.4 to
address the security vulnerabilities.
 
DTS-2371 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
Occasionally, Integration Server Administrator displays "[ISS.0030.0030] You
must log in to access the Administrator API."

Integration Server Administrator displays the error momentarily and lets the
user login.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2389 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
The pipeline editor in the Monitoring view of Integration Server Administrator
does not show fields that are not declared in the service signature. 

When using the Edit pipeline feature in the Monitoring view of Integration
Server Administrator, fields that are not declared in the service signature do
not appear. Specifically, if a service input signature contains a Document
variable with undefined content (an open document), the Edit pipeline feature
does not display any fields that exist in the Document at run time. 

Now, the pipeline editor in the Monitoring view displays the runtime contents of
the Document. 

DTS-2427 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
In Integration Server Administrator > Logs > Server, empty spaces appear at the
end of the Server log, when "Number of entries to display" exceeds the
number of entries in the Integration Server log.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2434 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
In Integration Server Administrator, the "Yes" and "No" buttons in the "Confirm
dismissal of all notifications" dialog are misaligned.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-2448 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix3)
In the Services page of Monitoring, you cannot simultaneously select all
services that can be resubmitted. 

The issue is resolved. You can now use the checkbox in the header of the search
results table to select all services that can be resubmitted. 

PIE-78523 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix2)
System packages include JAR files for third party libraries that already exist
in the <IntegrationServer>\lib\jars directory. 

The code/jars/static directory in some webMethods system packages (WmAdmin,
WmCloud, and WmIntegrationLiveServer) contain third-party JAR files already in
the <IntegrationServer>\lib\jars directory. This is unnecessary as system
packages should rely on JAR files already present in the Integration Server
installation library. 

This issue is now resolved. After applying a fix that includes PIE-78523, the
system packages will no longer contain the duplicated JAR files. 

DTS-2184 (IS_10.15_WmAdmin_Fix1)
When Integration Server runs with the Turkish locale, accessing the new
Integration Server Administrator sometimes results in the error "License key is
expired or invalid".

The issue is now fixed.
