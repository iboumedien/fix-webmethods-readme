7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-88214
Creating Integration Server users through Command Central using allowed ASCII 
characters in the user ID causes an exception.

When creating Integration Server users through Command Central with the allowed
ASCII characters in the userid results in then following error due to an 
Integration Server SPM issue:
"User ID is not valid. User ID contains non-ASCII characters".

This issue is now resolved

PIE-92407
High system utilization is reported in CloudStreams instances and Terracotta
servers. 

When two or more Integration Servers are installed with the same Software AG
Platform Manager (SPM), and one of the Integration Servers is down or not
reachable, all the Integration Server runtime-components are removed from the 
cache which leads to this issue.

This issue is resolved. Now, when one Integration Server is down, only that
Integration Server runtime-component and its parent are removed from cache.

PIE-92925
The Integration Server implementation with Command Central (CCE) displays 
package-level global variables, despite CCE not supporting package-level global 
variables.

When Integration Server has global variables defined at both the package and 
server level, CCE fetches and shows both types of variables. As CCE does not 
support package-level global variables, the SPM plugin should skip displaying 
these variables rather than showing them. However, CCE displays the 
package-level global variables.

This issue is now resolved by updating the SPM plugin to skip displaying
package-level global variables in CCE.

PIE-77197 (IS_10.15_SPM_Fix1)
Migration log is not visible on the Command Central Jobs page.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77625 (IS_10.15_SPM_Fix1)
In Command Central, clicking the Overview or Configuration tab for the Monitor 
component in "Home > Instances > ALL > [instance_name] > Monitor" incorrectly 
throws the "Unexpected component status" although the Monitor component is 
online. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-81002 (IS_10.15_SPM_Fix1)
Updating an SFTP server alias without a client version number through
a template in Command Central or a REST client results in a null pointer
exception. 

This issue is now resolved.
