Installer Shared Libraries Scripts 10.15.0 Fix 1



2.0 Fix ID

WIS_10.15_SharedResources_Fix1



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix updates the common/bin/daemon.sh command line tool,
which affects all products that register daemons on Linux systems.

None.

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section of the Software AG Empower Product
Support website at https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp



5.0 Platform Support

Installer Shared Libraries Scripts 10.15.0 Fix 1 is supported on
all Linux platforms.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

This fix updates the daemon.sh command line tool. If a daemon for Platform Manager is registered
before the installation of this fix, then you must unregister and register that daemon again after
installing the fix. The unregistration and registration must be done manually using command line for each daemon.
The following example unregisters and registers the daemon for Platform Manager:

/Software AG_directory/common/bin/daemon.sh -f /Software AG_directory/profiles/SPM/bin/sagspm101

For more information see "Installing Software AG products", Appendix A.



7.0 Fix Contents

WIR-14650

In certain conditions the script 'afterInstallAsRoot.sh' might remove services which belong to other
webMethods installation directories. This has been fixed with a new version of the utility
common/bin/daemon.sh.

The issue is resolved. The utility common/bin/daemon.sh has been updated with the fix. If the option
'-i ID' with the common/bin/daemon.sh utility points to an existing service definition of
a start/stop script for a different service, then the next higher available ID will be used to
create the service file.



8.0 Installation

Use Command Central to install fixes on multiple machines from a central  location (9.7 or later
products), or Software AG Update Manager to install fixes on one machine at a time. For instructions,

9.0 Uninstallation

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action

support for operation in any country, locale, or language as specified in the Installing webMethods
Products guide. It was not tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this
fix has no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported locale or
configuration.
