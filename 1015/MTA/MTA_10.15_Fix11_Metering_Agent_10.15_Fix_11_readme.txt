 MTA-1831
In webMethods Metering, after PC time synchronization, usage data collection might stop or return incorrect values.
This issue is now resolved.

 MTA-1772
When generating logs, the Software AG Metering Agent might throw a ZoneRulesException error.
The issue is resolved.

The logs of Metering Agent are revisited and updated.
 MTA-1741
After installing CJP_10.15_Fix354 that upgrades to Java 17, the Software AG Metering dry run check fails and the Metering Agent does not send usage data to the central server.
This issue is resolved. Software AG Metering is now compatible with Java 17.
 MTA-1120
When Software AG Metering collects data for a product that has more than two profiles
or instances, the Metering Agent might throw a NoSuchFileException error.
This issue is resolved.

the storage directory is not yet created.
This is fixed now.
 MTA-1068

storage directory.
The issue is resolved. Obsolete usage measurement files are now automatically deleted from
the metering storage directory.
 MTA-1032
In Software AG Metering, the runtime alias does not support double quotes
and backslash characters.
This issue is resolved. You can now use double quotes and backslash characters
when you configure a runtime alias.
 MTA-955
With Software AG Metering, when the underlying network setup does not allow the retrieval
of the fully quilified domain name (FQDN) or the same FQDN is assigned to different product
instances, the same runtime ID might be assigned to these product instances.

This issue is resolved. All product instances that are deployed on a system with a unique
hostname now have unique runtime IDs that are listed in the corresponding wrapper.log files.
For details on finding the runtime ID of a product instance, see the Software AG Infrastructure
Administrator�s Guide.

in the metering.agent.properties file
Use metering.proxy.user and metering.proxy.pass as Java System properties
Use METERING_PROXY_USER and METERING_PROXY_PASS as environment variables
