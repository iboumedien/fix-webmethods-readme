NUM-23913 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix25)

The Universal Messaging realm servers fail to join a Universal Messaging cluster with an error. As a 
result, the Universal Messaging clients cannot establish a connection to the realm servers or the 
connection is slow.
The Universal Messaging realm servers might fail to join the cluster when the client connection 
attempt accumulates a large amount of unexpected data exchanged during the authentication. The 
servers log the following error: "Remote connection failed security challenge".
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23401 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix25)

The RealmInformationCollector diagnostic tool offers a new collector, jmxexporter, that collects the 
jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file, the configuration file of the Prometheus JMX exporter agent. The 
jmxexporter collector is available in both live and offline mode.
In addition, the threadcpuusage.txt file generated by the threaddump collector has enhanced output.

NUM-23707 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix24)

The display names of the fix packages that deliver updates to the Java Service Wrapper for Linux, 
AIX, and macOS operating systems have been changed to better indicate their purpose.

NUM-23466 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix24)

Universal Messaging uses the Protobuf library version 3.21.12, which has a security vulnerability.
The issue is resolved. The Protobuf library has been updated to version 3.25.5.

NUM-23600 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix24)

In Universal Messaging, exceeding the warning threshold configured for direct and heap memory might 
result in degraded JVM performance.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23356 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix23)

The description of the DisableExplicitGC realm configuration property in the Universal Messaging 
Enterprise Manager and Administration API is incorrect.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23355 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix23)

When you set the DisableExplicitGC realm configuration property to ?false?, the Universal Messaging 
server might override this value when it performs the next check for memory usage exceeding the 
warning threshold.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23083 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix23)

Ensure that the last EID for a channel is at least set to the highest EID of the store in order to 
prevent a possible cluster recovery loop.

NUM-23275 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix22)

After a Universal Messaging Realm restarts, the number of current connections might be incorrect 
because of a memory leak. The issue occurs if a subscription was removed while the realm was down.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-21404 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix21)

When UM server or client is trying to do reverse lookup for the client ip, more logs are added at 
the appropriate log levels, to indicate whether the DNS lookup consumes more time than expected. 
This will provide more information in identifying issues with client-server connectivity.
Also, the connection time threshold for logging the message as an error is reduced.

NUM-22801 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix20)

Reconnect logic uses uses JMS flag which results in dead session to be left in session pool. As part 
of the fix, Flag for shouldTryToReconnect() logic is set separately for native session and JMS. 
For native session, the flag can be set/unset from environment variable 
"com.softwareag.um.client.retry_reconnect_on_security_exception" with default value being true. For 
JMS, it can be set/unset using com.pcbsys.nirvana.nJMS.Constants#setReconnectAfterAccessChange() 
API, by default value is set to false.

NUM-22840 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix19)

Universal Messaging now supports both Java 17 and Java 11 as a runtime for the server, client, and 
sample applications components.

NUM-22582 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix18)

The Cluster Status panel of the Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager and the ClusterState 
command-line tool display long values for ?Broadcast Time" and "Response Time" instead of dates.
The issue is resolved. Besides showing a correct date value, the "Broadcast Time" and "Response 
Time" properties have been renamed to "Last Broadcast Time" and "Last Response Time".

NUM-21407 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix18)

Improved logging when different threads try to close an http connection simultaneously in a 
Universal Messaging client.

NUM-21337 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix18)

On the Windows platform JVM's do not support millisecond resolution when using the 
java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport#parkNanos methods causing delays up to 15 milliseconds when 
expecting only 1 millisecond. A solution has been implemented that overcomes this issue by enabling 
1 millisecond clock resolution with the use of java.lang.Thread#sleep(long) on a thread for the 
life of the JVM.

NUM-21311 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix18)

The CreateJMSQueue and CreateJMSTopic tools, and any other Universal Messaging command-line 
administration tools associated with stores (channels and queues) now create stores of type Mixed 
when you use the tool without specifying the store type.
Previously, the tools created stores of type Reliable.
In addition, in the Universal Messaging Java client API, the constructors 
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nChannelAttributes.nChannelAttributes() and 
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nChannelAttributes.nChannelAttributes(String name) now create mixed 
stores by default instead of reliable ones.
Also, the methods in nSession and nRealmNode that create channels or queues create mixed stores 
instead of reliable ones if you do not set the type of the store (channel or queue) explicitly.
You can use a new system property on the client side, com.softwareag.um.client.DefaultChannelType, 
to specify the type of stores created when using the administration tools and the 
nChannelAttributes constructors. Valid values are ?mixed?, ?reliable?, and ?persistent?. 

NUM-20414 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix16)

In Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager, the Connections tab > Connection Summary panel for a 
channel displays an incorrect number of connections.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-21392 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix16)

Improved logging during session life cycle in Universal Messaging clients.

NUM-20881 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix15)

In a slow environment, a Universal Messaging (UM) server might delay sending a keepalive response to 
a UM client, which could disconnect the client.
The issue is resolved. You can use a new UM client-side property, 
"com.softwareag.um.client.server_keep_alive_leeway", to specify the additional time it can take a 
UM server to reply to a keepalive sent by a UM client. The default value is 15 seconds. You can 
increase the keepalive leeway if the UM server is under heavy load that might cause a delay in the 
keepalive reply. Such a delay can sometimes disconnect UM clients, so you have the option to 
increase the allowed delay before a client closes a connection due to a failed keepalive.
For more information about working with client properties, see the Universal Messaging 
documentation.

NUM-20272 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix15)

During network latency, the Universal Messaging NHP and NHPS communication drivers might not perform 
optimally, which might result in many network events queueing on the client side.
When the client encounters network latency and with enough concurrent requests in a request-reply 
scenario, the server's NHP and NHPS drivers are overwhelmed when using the default configuration.
The issue is resolved. Logging has been enhanced and the max buffer size of the drivers has been 
increased from 10 KB to 100 MB when a request is sent. When you set the 
'com.softwareag.um.client.write_handler' client property
to 'queue' each request is filled before being sent.
In addition, you can use the following new client properties to change the default behavior of the 
communication drivers in case of network delays and to enhance logging:
com.softwareag.um.client.MaximumContentLengthPerHTTPRequest=<bytes>
Specifies the maximum number of bytes that a single HTTP request can send. Default is 103809024, or 
99 MB in bytes.
com.softwareag.um.client.EventSerializationTimeLoggingThreshold=<milliseconds>
Specifies a threshold in milliseconds beyond which the client writes a log message to help find 
network delays. The measurement is taken while serializing an event into bytes. Default is 1000 
milliseconds.
com.softwareag.um.client.NetworkFlushTimeLoggingThreshold=<milliseconds>
Specifies a threshold in milliseconds beyond which the client writes a log message to help find 
network delays during OutputStream flush calls. The measurement is taken while calling the 
highest-level flush and an additional
log message is produced in the lowest area where multiple flush calls could be executed. Default is 
5000 milliseconds.
com.softwareag.um.client.OutboundQueueSizeLoggingThreshold=<number_of_events>
Specifies a threshold beyond which the client writes a
log message to help find queued network events waiting to be sent by the client. This indicates an 
upcoming timeout on requests and potentially timed-out requests due to the client not receiving a 
reply from the server. Default is 50 events.
com.softwareag.um.client.MarkTimedOutEventDeleted=true|false
Changes the behavior when the client sends a synchronous request, if the request times out on the 
client side before it is sent. In this case, the event is deleted, which can result in quicker 
recovery of a bad state and in not sending superfluous data. Default is 'true'.
For more information about setting client properties, see the Universal Messaging documentation.

NUM-20251 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix14)

In Universal Messaging, you can create duplicate stores (channels or queues) for a particular store 
name, which might result in duplicate or lost events.
The store names contain the same sequence of letters but have different cases for the characters, 
for example, testQueue and TestQueue.
The issue is resolved.
Important: After you apply this fix, the Universal Messaging server will not start if there are 
duplicate stores for a particular store name present on the server when you work with 
case-insensitive data folders, for example, on a Windows operating system. Contact Software AG 
Global Support on how to proceed.
When you start the Universal Messaging server, it checks for duplicate stores and shuts down if it 
finds any such stores. The server also writes the following warning message in the nirvana.log file 
and in the console output: ?WARNING: Multiple stores found for store name: <Store name>. Listing 
the stores for this store name: <Store 1><Store 2>??
In addition, you can no longer create duplicate stores when you work with a case-insensitive data 
folder.
When starting, the server now detects what type of file system is used, case-sensitive or 
case-insensitive, and sets the ?isCaseSensitive? flag. If the detection process fails, the server 
uses the default value of the flag, which is ?true?. If you create a store for a store name that 
conflicts with an existing name on the server, Universal Messaging displays the following message: 
?There is a conflict in the given store name.?
Previously, you could use the property ?caseSensitive? in a config.props file to set this flag and 
specify whether the system was case-sensitive or not. This property has been removed. The default 
value of the flag was ?true?. If the flag was set to ?false?, operations on a channel would use 
lowercase for comparison of the store name.

NUM-20696 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix13)

When you try to modify the JNDI settings for a UM realm server, Enterprise Manager does not load the 
settings on the JNDI tab correctly.
During the hostname resolution if Enterprise Manager cannot reach the resolved host and port, the 
JNDI settings on the JNDI tab are not loaded correctly. The issue occurs when you are using a 
firewall, VPN, or you have an issue with the DNS.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-20804 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix13)

If you set setReconnectAfterAccessChange(..) to false, if the client receives nSecurityException for 
cluster formation or for exceeding the connection limit, these exceptions are treated as 
recoverable and the client will try to reconnect to the Universal Messaging server. For any other 
security exceptions, the client will make no reconnection attempts."

NUM-20711 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix13)

A Java client session that uses the Universal Messaging HTTP protocol (NHP) might take longer to 
close. The issue occurs when the client session is routed via an HTTP proxy with chunked transfer 
encoding enabled.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20613 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix12)

Universal Messaging now uses the Java Service Wrapper version 3.5.53 on Linux, AIX, and macOS 
operating systems.
A script will modify and switch any existing Universal Messaging server instances running on Linux, 
AIX, and macOS to the Java Service Wrapper version 3.5.53.

NUM-18957 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix12)

Updated the openssl library version to 3.0.9 which has fix to critical vulnerability

NUM-20269 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix11)

? new realm ACL permission, Override Connection Count, has been added to the Security > ACL tab for 
a realm in the Enterprise Manager.
The Override Connection Count permission allows a user with an admin connection to connect to a 
realm even when the connection limit set in the MaxNoOfConnections and 
MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName realm configuration properties is exceeded. 

NUM-20268 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix11)

Connection failure in the client buries the underlying exception which is resolved now.
"If the initialization of a session fails, in some scenarios, Universal Messing clients now receive 
an exception other than nRealmUnreachableException, which can help to better determine the cause of 
the failure. The change is introduced to make exceptions more transparent to clients. Now clients 
can also receive exceptions such as nSessionNotConnectedException, 
nSessionAlreadyInitialisedException, and nSecurityException. When connections exceed the limit set 
by the MaxNoOfConnections and MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName properties, clients receive 
nSecurityException.

NUM-20216 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix11)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party Xerces library used in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved. The Xerces jar used in Universal Messaging has been upgraded to version 
2.12.1 from versions 2.11 and 2.3.

NUM-19953 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix10)

The following issues are observed in Universal Messaging: 
- NullPointerException when auto-acknowledging events for queues.
- Leaked asynchronous queue connection readers retaining pending events for a queue.
- Continuous rollback of events for a queue.
These issues are resolved.

NUM-19887 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix10)

Using JMX, you can monitor only one Universal Messaging HTTP-SocketAccept or
HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pool at a time and you cannot identify which thread
pool you are monitoring.
Out of many existing HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pools,
you can monitor only one at a time using JMX and it is not clear which one it is.
The JMX monitoring tool just displays the generic name HTTP-SocketAccept.
The issue happens because the socket accept thread pool name does not include
the name of the corresponding Universal Messaging interface and the JMX server
cannot identify the different thread pools.
The issue is resolved. Now each HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread
pool name includes the name of the corresponding interface, for example,
HTTP-SocketAccept-nhp1, and all thread pools are visible and identifiable in your
JMX monitoring tool.

NUM-19810 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix9)

Before the fix, user is unable to create/Delete the site in Enterprise Manager -> Cluster -> Sites 
tab. Site tab did not display the Site details if the sites are already present.
After this fix, User will be able to create/delete the Site from Enterprise Manager. The Site 
details will also be displayed in Enterprise Manager Site panel if the site details are present

NUM-19413 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix9)

Adding or modifying supported ciphers for a Universal Messaging server SSL interface using 
command-line tools might fail.
When you run the AddHTTPSInterface, AddSSLInterface, or ModifyInterface command-line tools and 
specify the 'ciphers' optional parameter, the tools might fail to execute, although the specified 
ciphers are part of the list of supported SSL ciphers. Adding a cipher might fail with the 
following error: "Illegal argument passed: Cipher not found in supported cipher list".
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19293 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix6)

Creation of an interface when there is an existing interface with the same port was allowed.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-19302 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix6)

When Integration Server uses Universal Messaging as a JMS provider, it might stop responding when 
you try to enable or disable JMS triggers.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19410 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix5)

Universal Messaging now supports defining the number of concurrent connections per user.
You can use a new realm configuration property, "MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName", part of the 
"Connection Config" group in the Enterprise Manager, to specify the number of concurrent 
connections per user. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of connections. 
Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647. When you set a limit, if connections exceed the 
specified number, the client will get an nSecurityException. However, admin connections with the 
"Realm Override Connection Count" permission are still allowed to connect to the realm server.
In addition, the existing "MaxNoOfConnections" property, controls the total number of concurrent 
connections to the server. When you set a limit on the total number, connections that exceed the 
limit are rejected if they are non-admin connections or if they do not have the "Realm Override 
Connection Count" permission. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of 
connections. Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647.

NUM-18564 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix4)

A Universal Messaging client might take a long time to detect a connection failure.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging keep-alive performance has been optimized for improved 
detection of broken socket connections.
For all nSession clients, each client will now check for the reception of a server-side keep alive. 
Note that you configure server-side keep-alive intervals by setting the "KeepAlive" realm 
configuration property under "Connection Config" in Enterprise Manager. If this keep alive is not 
received on time, the session is closed, and a reconnection attempt is made. Also note that 
reconnections can be disabled at an API level.
In addition, you can use a new Java system property, com.softwareag.um.client.missed_keep_alives=<n> 
to set the number of missed server-side keep alives before a connection is closed.
Java system property reference
com.softwareag.um.client.missed_keep_alives=<n>
Specifies the number of missed server-side keep alives before a connection is closed. The default 
value is 1. A value of 1 means that if a single keep alive is missed by the client, the session is 
closed. To disable server-side keep alive checking, set the Java property to 0 (zero).
Note that the Java property is consulted only once upon JVM startup.
Important: If you experience issues with lost connections or duplicate messages after applying this 
fix, particularly with multiplexed sessions, you should adjust the value of 
"com.softwareag.um.client.missed_keep_alives". To resolve such issues, Software AG recommends that 
you first set the property to a value greater than or equal to two. However, if the issues persist 
after some time, disable the fix altogether by setting the property value to zero.
For more information, see the Universal Messaging Java API documentation on:
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nConstants#setPermittedKeepAlivesMissed
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nConstants.MISSED_KEEP_ALIVES
For more information about the "KeepAlive" realm configuration property, see the Universal Messaging 
Administration Guide.

NUM-19125 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix3)

The Universal Messaging TraceStores realm configuration property in Enterprise Manager is not 
updated correctly.
You cannot remove the names of all the stores specified in the TraceStores configuration property. 
At least one store that you cannot delete remains specified.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19116 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix3)

When we are deleting the durable, we are deregistering and removing all the viewers and panels 
attached to a nDurable object, before deleting the actual object.

NUM-18339 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix3)

A Universal Messaging Java client fails to connect to the server when the hostname of the server or 
of the machine that hosts the server contains special characters, such as an underscore.
The issue occurs because the Java URI API does not support special characters in hostnames.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18812 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix2)

An additional console opens when you start Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18412 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix2)

The close button of the "Retry Connection" in Enterprise Manager does not prevent the message from 
showing up.
The close button of the "Retry Connection" in Enterprise Manager does not act the same as if the 
"No" button is clicked. The "Retry Connection" message window keeps showing up although the close 
button has been clicked. 
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18668 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix2)

When you enable the ThreadDumpOnSlowTask thread-pool monitoring property, Universal Messaging might 
generate many thread dumps over a short time, which could slow performance.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18469 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix2)

Connecting to Universal Messaging from an OSGi application might fail because the Universal 
Messaging OSGi nClient.jar library forces you to install log4j-related jars even though they are 
not used.
The issue occurs because the log4j jars in the nClient.jar library have been added as mandatory 
import packages.
The issue is resolved. The log4j-related jars in nClient.jar have been changed to optional import 
packages.

NUM-18421 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix2)

Universal Messaging might log thread dumps twice in nirvana.log.
When a stalled or slow moving task is detected, or a thread dump is requested, it might be logged 
twice in nirvana.log which is unnecessary.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18317 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix2)

Configuring Universal Messaging thread pool monitoring is not available on the client side.
Universal Messaging does not provide a mechanism for the client API to control the thread pool 
monitoring
configuration, such as stalled task timeout, slow task timeout, or idle thread timeout. This 
prevents the client
from easily adjusting these monitoring settings for specific needs.
The issue is resolved. You can use the following new system properties on the client side to 
configure thread pool monitoring:
-com.softwareag.um.client.IdleThreadTimeout (default 60000ms)
-com.softwareag.um.client.StalledTaskWarningTime (default 60000ms)
-com.softwareag.um.client.PendingTaskErrorThreshold (default 1000)
-com.softwareag.um.client.PendingTaskWarningThreshold (default 100)
-com.softwareag.um.client.SlowMovingTasksTimeout (default 5000ms)
For more information about these client properties, see the Universal Messaging documentation.

NUM-18456 (NUM_10.15_wM_Client_Fix1)

When you export a realm configuration in an xml file using Enterprise Manager, Universal Messaging 
wrongly appends "@" at the end of a join destination.
The issue occurs when the source channel in a join has a namespace.
This issue is now resolved. 


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix, 
please shut down any applications such as Integration Server 
or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager 
fix, you do not need to shut down the Universal Messaging server.

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager or 
Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions, see the 
corresponding documentation 
at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the 
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your 
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot 
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was not 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this fix has
no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported 
locale or configuration.



10.1 Localization

This fix does not require an updated Language Pack. It might contain new 
messages and these messages will appear in English.
