Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.
 	
This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.

NUM-23707 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix24)

The display names of the fix packages that deliver updates to the Java Service Wrapper for Linux, 
AIX, and macOS operating systems have been changed to better indicate their purpose.

NUM-23466 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix24)

Universal Messaging uses the Protobuf library version 3.21.12, which has a security vulnerability.
The issue is resolved. The Protobuf library has been updated to version 3.25.5.

NUM-22840 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix19)

Universal Messaging now supports both Java 17 and Java 11 as a runtime for the server, client, and 
sample applications components.

NUM-22582 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix18)

The Cluster Status panel of the Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager and the ClusterState 
command-line tool display long values for ?Broadcast Time" and "Response Time" instead of dates.
The issue is resolved. Besides showing a correct date value, the "Broadcast Time" and "Response 
Time" properties have been renamed to "Last Broadcast Time" and "Last Response Time".

NUM-20696 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix13)

When you try to modify the JNDI settings for a UM realm server, Enterprise Manager does not load the 
settings on the JNDI tab correctly.
During the hostname resolution if Enterprise Manager cannot reach the resolved host and port, the 
JNDI settings on the JNDI tab are not loaded correctly. The issue occurs when you are using a 
firewall, VPN, or you have an issue with the DNS.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-20613 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix12)

Universal Messaging now uses the Java Service Wrapper version 3.5.53 on Linux, AIX, and macOS 
operating systems.
A script will modify and switch any existing Universal Messaging server instances running on Linux, 
AIX, and macOS to the Java Service Wrapper version 3.5.53.

NUM-20269 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix11)

? new realm ACL permission, Override Connection Count, has been added to the Security > ACL tab for 
a realm in the Enterprise Manager.
The Override Connection Count permission allows a user with an admin connection to connect to a 
realm even when the connection limit set in the MaxNoOfConnections and 
MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName realm configuration properties is exceeded. 

NUM-19810 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix9)

Before the fix, user is unable to create/Delete the site in Enterprise Manager -> Cluster -> Sites 
tab. Site tab did not display the Site details if the sites are already present.
After this fix, User will be able to create/delete the Site from Enterprise Manager. The Site 
details will also be displayed in Enterprise Manager Site panel if the site details are present

NUM-19293 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix6)

Creation of an interface when there is an existing interface with the same port was allowed.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-19410 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix5)

Universal Messaging now supports defining the number of concurrent connections per user.
You can use a new realm configuration property, "MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName", part of the 
"Connection Config" group in the Enterprise Manager, to specify the number of concurrent 
connections per user. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of connections. 
Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647. When you set a limit, if connections exceed the 
specified number, the client will get an nSecurityException. However, admin connections with the 
"Realm Override Connection Count" permission are still allowed to connect to the realm server.
In addition, the existing "MaxNoOfConnections" property, controls the total number of concurrent 
connections to the server. When you set a limit on the total number, connections that exceed the 
limit are rejected if they are non-admin connections or if they do not have the "Realm Override 
Connection Count" permission. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of 
connections. Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647.

NUM-19125 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix3)

The Universal Messaging TraceStores realm configuration property in Enterprise Manager is not 
updated correctly.

showing up.
The close button of the "Retry Connection" in Enterprise Manager does not act the same as if the 
"No" button is clicked. The "Retry Connection" message window keeps showing up although the close 
button has been clicked. 
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18456 (NUM_10.15_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

When you export a realm configuration in an xml file using Enterprise Manager, Universal Messaging 
wrongly appends "@" at the end of a join destination.
The issue occurs when the source channel in a join has a namespace.
This issue is now resolved. 


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix, 
please shut down any applications such as Integration Server 
or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager 
fix, you do not need to shut down the Universal Messaging server.

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager or 
Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions, see the 
corresponding documentation 
at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the 
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your 
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot 
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was not 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this fix has
no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported 
locale or configuration.
