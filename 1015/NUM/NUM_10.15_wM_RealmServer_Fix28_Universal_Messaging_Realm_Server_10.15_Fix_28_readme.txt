are patched together with the realm server binaries, and that both are kept
up to date with the latest Universal Messaging official fix set.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.
 	
This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.

NUM-24584 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix28)

The Universal Messaging server logs an “Unknown consumer type“ error message 
when loading durable objects during startup. The issue is resolved. 
The redundant error messages are now removed from the log file.
Removing the incorrect error message from that states that existing consumer types are unknown 
and also optimizing log message to be printed only when a migration is actually happening.

NUM-24483 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix27)

Upgraded the prometheus jmx exporter jar to version 1.2.0.

NUM-24306 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix26)

NPE can happen while server is processing addition of a connection listener to a channel with 
indexed durable and in the meantime a new async subscriber is connected to this durable. This issue 
is now fixed

NUM-24200 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix26)

When working with Universal Messaging (UM) clusters in a cross-cluster environment that includes 
different UM versions, a deadlock condition might occur.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-24178 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix26)

A potential event loss scenario is possible if a UM server has a remote join to another UM server or 
cluster.
This issue is now resolved after the application of this fix.

NUM-24057 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix26)

Universal Messaging server audit logging has been enhanced with connection information when the 
global connection limit and the connection limit per user are reached.

NUM-23825 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix26)

The Universal Messaging server does not respond when the server is under heavy load of scheduled 
tasks.
The issue occurs because the Universal Messaging scheduling has reduced capacity to process 
scheduled tasks simultaneously.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23770 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix26)

The client side API com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nSession#deleteRealm has been changed to ensure that 
the realm name to be removed is first removed locally on the connected realm server before the 
connected realm server name is removed remotely. This API is also used in the Enterprise Manager 
whenever a realm server is first selected and the right mouse button context menu item "Remove A 
Realm" is executed or performed.
In addition, you can use a new realm configuration property, "RemoteJoinContextStatsInterval", to 
log join statistics at a specified interval in milliseconds. You configure the property on the 
Config tab for a realm in the Enterprise Manager, as part of the Join Config property group. A 
value between 0 (default) and less than 5000 disables logging. The minimum logging interval is 
5000.
For more information about working with realm configuration properties, see the Universal Messaging 
documentation.

NUM-23913 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix25)

The Universal Messaging realm servers fail to join a Universal Messaging cluster with the following 
error: "Remote connection failed security challenge". The Universal Messaging clients cannot 
establish a connection to the realm servers or the connection is slow with the same error message.
The issue occurs because of incorrect header values exchanged during the authentication.
The issue is resolved. A new parameter with name com.softwareag.um.authentication.maxHeaderCount and 
default value of 0 has been added to limit the number of headers exchanged. Do not change the 
default value of the parameter as it is used when the server communicates with a client that uses 
headers.

NUM-23436 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix25)

An active/active cluster might disconnect if the load of the realm events from Shared or Serial 
durable subscribers is too high.
When the number of channel or queue events is very high, the rebuild of the subscriber filter or the 
additional synchronization of events in the cluster might block the inter-cluster communication.
The issue is resolved. Now an active/active cluster does not disconnect under a very high load of 
realm events.

NUM-23024 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix25)

Universal Messaging server logging has been improved to better identify client details.

NUM-23707 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

The display names of the fix packages that deliver updates to the Java Service Wrapper for Linux, 
AIX, and macOS operating systems have been changed to better indicate their purpose.

NUM-23644 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

Snooping on the outstanding events on a durable using Command Central, the Universal Messaging 
Enterprise Manager, or the Universal Messaging client API might lead to stalled tasks on a 
Universal Messaging server.
This can have undesired consequences such as, for example, a split-brain cluster state, that is, the 
existence of more than one master node in the cluster.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23629 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

When monitoring Universal Messaging, the Prometheus JMX Exporter agent removes the suffix "total" 
from the names of rules of type ?gauge? and the suffix "info" from the names of rules of any type.
The issue is resolved. The affected rules are renamed to match the output of the Prometheus JMX 
Exporter.

NUM-23600 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

In Universal Messaging, exceeding the warning threshold configured for direct and heap memory might 
result in degraded JVM performance.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23531 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

JavaScript clients might be unable to connect to a Universal Messaging server when thousands of 
JavaScript clients try to connect to the server.
In such conditions, the server might become overloaded and start dropping further connection 
requests.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-23507 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

Establishing a client connection to a Universal Messaging server might fail.
The issue happens because in rare cases stream corruption during handshaking might occur.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-23466 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

Universal Messaging uses the Protobuf library version 3.21.12, which has a security vulnerability.
The issue is resolved. The Protobuf library has been updated to version 3.25.5.

NUM-23342 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

The Universal Messaging server does not update its garbage collection (GC) state.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-22900 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix24)

An ack/rollback request for an indexed durable on a slave node may timeout and cause the slave to be 
disconnected from a cluster if the corresponding channel or durable is deleted.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-23500 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

NUM-23500
Prevent a loop cycle of nJoinFind attempts specifically for newly created channels.
When a remote join between servers or clusters first attempts to connect to a destination from a 
newly created channel, a loop cycle of nJoinFind attempts can occur when only 1 will suffice. This 
cycle can also fill up the server log with repeated entries that take up a lot of disk space, thus 
impacting the server's overall performance.
The fix for this issue will break the loop cycle and ensure that only 1 nJoinFind attempt occurs 
after connecting successfully to the destination.

NUM-23494 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

The log level for the specific message Flow Control enabled for Connection with ID has been changed 
from warn to debug to reduce the amount of non-critical log entries in the nirvana.log file. This 
adjustment helps clean up the logs, making them easier to read and understand, while still 
providing detailed Flow Control information at the debug level when needed for troubleshooting.

NUM-23356 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

The description of the DisableExplicitGC realm configuration property in the Universal Messaging 
Enterprise Manager and Administration API is incorrect.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23343 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

The Prometheus JMX exporter has been upgraded to version 1.0.1, which provides better scraping 
performance.

NUM-23324 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

The shutdown speed of a Universal Messaging server has been optimized.
Depending on the configuration and load of the server, shutdown can be 5 percent to 10 percent 
quicker.

NUM-23211 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

Prometheus scraping of Universal Messaging metrics is slow.
The issue occurs because the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file, the configuration file of the Prometheus 
JMX exporter agent, contains some rules that do not provide useful information for monitoring but 
degrade performance. These rules are:
sag_um_topic_durable_connection_acknowledged_total
sag_um_topic_durable_connection_rolledBack_total
sag_um_topic_durable_connection_pending_total
sag_um_queue_connection_acknowledged_total
sag_um_queue_connection_rolledBack_total
sag_um_queue_connection_pending_total
The issue is resolved. The superfluous rules have been removed from the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml 
file.

NUM-23083 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

Ensure that the last EID for a channel is at least set to the highest EID of the store in order to 
prevent a possible cluster recovery loop.

NUM-23328 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix22)

A Universal Messaging server now performs a complete shutdown after waiting for a default graceful 
shutdown period of 40 seconds. Previously the graceful shutdown period was 10 seconds.
You can also use a new server parameter, "com.softwareag.um.server.ServerShutdownTimeOut?, to 
configure the time in seconds for a graceful shutdown after which the server shuts down forcefully. 
Valid values are between 10 seconds and 3600 seconds. The default value is 40 seconds. If you 
specify values that are below or above the valid range, Universal Messaging adjusts these values to 
the minimum value of 10 or the maximum value of 3600, respectively.
In addition, the shutdown period of servers in a cluster has been improved.

NUM-23081 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix21)

The following JVM options introduced in Universal Messaging 10.15 Fix 19 to support Java 17 as a 
runtime are removed from the Server_Common.conf file because they are unnecessary:
-wrapper.java.additional.300=--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED
-wrapper.java.additional.301=--add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED 
However, the Universal Messaging server and Java client applications using the admin or client API 
still need these options in the following cases:
- To use the Universal Messaging server 10.15 with Java 17 after you migrate from an older Universal 
Messaging version that had stores of type Paged. You must add the two options to the 
Server_Common.conf or Custom_Server_Common.conf file as additional parameters.
- To use shared memory with Java 17. You must add the two options to the Server_Common.conf or 
Custom_Server_Common.conf file of the Universal Messaging server as additional parameters and to 
the JVM that starts the Java client application.

NUM-21404 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix21)

When UM server or client is trying to do reverse lookup for the client ip, more logs are added at 
the appropriate log levels, to indicate whether the DNS lookup consumes more time than expected. 
This will provide more information in identifying issues with client-server connectivity.
Also, the connection time threshold for logging the message as an error is reduced.

NUM-21758 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

A Universal Messaging server might shut down with out-of-memory (OOM) errors after cluster or 
channel recovery.
The issue occurs because during recovery a large window of large events, 100 or more events, is 
loaded into the heap.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-21543 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

Updated bouncycastle libraries to 1.78.1 to address security vulnerabilities.

NUM-21496 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

When you delete a reliable queue, Universal Messaging does not remove the empty folder associated 
with the queue, which might slow down performance if many folders accumulate.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-22840 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix19)

Universal Messaging now supports both Java 17 and Java 11 as a runtime for the server, client, and 
sample applications components.

NUM-21734 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

A Universal Messaging server fails to start with a NullPointerException when there are empty indexed 
durables.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-21464 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

The following issues can occur in Universal Messaging when you use durable subscribers with filters:
- Connection to Universal Messaging is lost with the error ?java.util.NoSuchElementException: 
Reached end of iterator? in the nirvana.log file.
- Intermittent connectivity issues between cluster nodes.
- Consumers might not be able to consume events from durables.
The issues are resolved.

NUM-21411 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

Super users on remote hosts can bypass mandatory authentication regardless of the validity of their 
credentials.
The issue is now resolved. Only super users on localhost are exempt from authentication.

NUM-21337 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

On the Windows platform JVM's do not support millisecond resolution when using the 
java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport#parkNanos methods causing delays up to 15 milliseconds when 
expecting only 1 millisecond. A solution has been implemented that overcomes this issue by enabling 
1 millisecond clock resolution with the use of java.lang.Thread#sleep(long) on a thread for the 
life of the JVM.

NUM-21311 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

The CreateJMSQueue and CreateJMSTopic tools, and any other Universal Messaging command-line 
administration tools associated with stores (channels and queues) now create stores of type Mixed 
when you use the tool without specifying the store type.
Previously, the tools created stores of type Reliable.
In addition, in the Universal Messaging Java client API, the constructors 
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nChannelAttributes.nChannelAttributes() and 
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nChannelAttributes.nChannelAttributes(String name) now create mixed 
stores by default instead of reliable ones.
Also, the methods in nSession and nRealmNode that create channels or queues create mixed stores 
instead of reliable ones if you do not set the type of the store (channel or queue) explicitly.
You can use a new system property on the client side, com.softwareag.um.client.DefaultChannelType, 
to specify the type of stores created when using the administration tools and the 
nChannelAttributes constructors. Valid values are ?mixed?, ?reliable?, and ?persistent?. 

NUM-21421 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

Channel iterator could flood the server logs with the messages "Durable Connection Bean with same ID 
found while registering a new one, unregister the old one. Conn ID: <connID>" when trying to 
receive event.
Now it is fixed.

NUM-21248 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

Fixed a race condition NPE in the fPipedOutputStream class.

NUM-21116 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

A Universal Messaging client might log a socket exception when using session multiplexing with NHP 
and closing the last multiplex session for an NHP connection.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-21110 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

The Universal Messaging server might log an IllegalArgumentException when closing client connections
that use an SSL network interface with NIO (Non-blocking Input/Output) enabled.
The server does not ensure thread-safe access to the write buffer of SSL connections,
which might cause IllegalArgumentExceptions when flushing outgoing data before closing an SSL 
connection.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-20898 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix16)

Universal Messaging server unconditionally waits 100 ms when closing a client connection.
This issue is now resolved. Universal Messaging server only waits if there are any outbound events 
pending to be sent over the connection.

NUM-21180 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

UM previously supported only filters like: 'document.field = stringField',
but did not support filters like 'stringField=document.field', i.e. where RHS expression of filter 
contains document nested fields.
Now it is fixed and nested fields can be used in right hand side of  filter expression (for now 
except boolean fields values).

NUM-21111 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

When a Universal Messaging client gets disconnected from the server, the server logs a message that 
does not give a clear explanation why the issue occurs.
The issue is resolved. Now the message in the server log points to the exact reason for 
disconnecting the client in the following cases:
- If the client requests the session to close, the server logs the following message: "Reason : 
Client session requested clean session close"
- If the client gets disconnected because of an exception, the log entry includes the exception 
class name and the exception message (when available).

NUM-21046 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

The Universal Messaging server does not immediately dispose of connection driver objects of clients 
connected to an NHP interface using the NSP protocol, when those clients get disconnected, which 
might cause the JVM to crash with an OutOfMemory error.
Universal Messaging has a safeguard mechanism that periodically checks for stale connections and 
removes such connections from memory. The mechanism runs every 60 seconds by default. However, in 
high-load environments, when clients reconnect frequently, stale connection objects might pile up 
in memory before the mechanism gets triggered, which causes the JVM to crash with an OutOfMemory 
error.
This issue is resolved. Now the Universal Messaging server disposes of connection driver objects 
immediately when clients are disconnected.

NUM-21034 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

When updating protobuf descriptor for the channel and then cluster (all servers) is fully restarted 
the channel missed the new updated protobuf descriptor. 
Now it should be fixed.

NUM-20909 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

Universal Messaging deletes local stores when clustering is disabled in the license file, but a 
cluster configuration is already present on the server.
After you create a Universal Messaging cluster under a license that allows clustering and then 
update the license file to a license with disabled clustering, when you start the server, Universal 
Messaging deletes all local stores. The issue occurs because the cluster configuration is still 
present in the system.
The issue is resolved. Now the Universal Messaging server checks for such conditions and writes a 
warning in the nirvana.log file and in the console output. The server deletes local stores only 
when clustering is enabled in the license file and a cluster configuration is present in the data 
directory.

NUM-20602 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

Universal Messaging might not properly handle and report fatal errors during Input/Output (IO) 
operations of the server.
The issue is now resolved. Universal Messaging has been enhanced to log such errors in the 
nirvana.log file and to shut down the server if such errors occur during IO operations.

NUM-20557 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

A java.util.ConcurrentModificationException in nClusterConnectionManager can appear in a UM server 
log only when clustering is enabled and used.  This exception can occur due to dropped connections 
from within a cluster.
The issue is resolved by refactoring some cluster related code within the server.

NUM-20994 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

When you close all consumers that are subscribed to a durable, the server logs a 
NullPointerException.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20988 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

For optimized performance, Universal Messaging caches the rules for all server-statistics Prometheus 
metrics in the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml configuration file of the JMX Exporter agent.
Caching of the rules is enabled by default for the following metrics in the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml 
file:
- sag_um_server_memory_heap_usage_bytes
- sag_um_server_memory_heap_free_bytes
- sag_um_server_memory_heap_max_bytes
- sag_um_server_memory_direct_max_bytes
- sag_um_server_memory_direct_usage_bytes
- sag_um_server_memory_direct_free_bytes
- sag_um_server_disk_total_bytes
- sag_um_server_disk_usage_bytes
- sag_um_server_disk_free_bytes
- sag_um_server_cpu_usage_ratio
- sag_um_server_currentconnections_total
- sag_um_server_bytesin_bytes
- sag_um_server_bytesout_bytes
- sag_um_server_publishedevents_total
- sag_um_server_consumedevents_total
You can disable rule caching for a metric by setting the 'cache' label of the metric to 'false' in 
the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file.

NUM-20935 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party org.json library used in Universal Messaging 
[version 20230227].
This issue is resolved by upgrading org.json jar used in Universal Messaging from version 20230227 
to version 20231013.

NUM-20890 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

AMQP keep alives from a UM server may cause a decode-error during transport, or the idle timeout 
threshold may be missed due to improper keep alive processing on a UM server, causing an AMQP 
client to disconnect and close.
This issue is now resolved. AMQP clients should now remain connected unless gracefully shutdown, or 
the idle timeout threshold (if applicable) is exceeded after proper keep alive processing.

NUM-20871 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Out of memory could occur in rare cases because the Finalizer thread could be locked out by the UM 
channel purge mechanism. This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-20767 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

AMQP framing/decode errors are possible on the client side due to a possible race condition in the 
QPID Proton J library.
To resolve these errors, the server must synchronize access to a 
org.apache.qpid.proton.engine.Transport for all instances where frames could be written.

NUM-20251 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

In Universal Messaging, you can create duplicate stores (channels or queues) for a particular store 
name, which might result in duplicate or lost events.
The store names contain the same sequence of letters but have different cases for the characters, 
for example, testQueue and TestQueue.
The issue is resolved.
Important: After you apply this fix, the Universal Messaging server will not start if there are 
duplicate stores for a particular store name present on the server when you work with 
case-insensitive data folders, for example, on a Windows operating system. Contact Software AG 
Global Support on how to proceed.
When you start the Universal Messaging server, it checks for duplicate stores and shuts down if it 
finds any such stores. The server also writes the following warning message in the nirvana.log file 
and in the console output: ?WARNING: Multiple stores found for store name: <Store name>. Listing 
the stores for this store name: <Store 1><Store 2>??
In addition, you can no longer create duplicate stores when you work with a case-insensitive data 
folder.
When starting, the server now detects what type of file system is used, case-sensitive or 
case-insensitive, and sets the ?isCaseSensitive? flag. If the detection process fails, the server 
uses the default value of the flag, which is ?true?. If you create a store for a store name that 
conflicts with an existing name on the server, Universal Messaging displays the following message: 
?There is a conflict in the given store name.?
Previously, you could use the property ?caseSensitive? in a config.props file to set this flag and 
specify whether the system was case-sensitive or not. This property has been removed. The default 
value of the flag was ?true?. If the flag was set to ?false?, operations on a channel would use 
lowercase for comparison of the store name.

NUM-17141 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Improved performance of durables and queue consumers

NUM-20777 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

The 'sag_um_connections_per_user' and 'sag_um_server_memory_direct_free_bytes' metrics that 
Universal Messaging provides for monitoring are not visible in graphic tools that visualize data 
collected by Prometheus.
The issue happens because the two metrics are not properly exposed in the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml 
file.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20677 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Universal Messaging now supports plugins for all UM license types regardless of the 'Plugins' key 
value in the license file. 

NUM-20653 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

A Universal Messaging queue synchronous reader waits additional 300 seconds to process an event 
instead of two seconds. The issue is resolved.

NUM-20618 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

When working with Universal Messaging (UM) clusters in a cross-cluster environment that includes 
different UM versions, a deadlock condition might occur.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20614 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Added rescheduling of AutoUpdate task with 2000ms delay in cases where the connection to the remote 
node is missing from nRealmConnectionManager's connections list. The goal is to allow for the 
connection to be added to this collection as part of the connection initiation process and then 
execute the AutoUpdate task. The rescheduling is allowed in the span of 30 seconds.

NUM-20613 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging now uses the Java Service Wrapper version 3.5.53 on Linux, AIX, and macOS 
operating systems.
A script will modify and switch any existing Universal Messaging server instances running on Linux, 
AIX, and macOS to the Java Service Wrapper version 3.5.53.

NUM-20544 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging might still have high-CPU usage issues when using the AMQP protocol despite the 
AMQP performance optimizations introduced in NUM-17343.
The issue affects Universal Messaging versions 10.11 and 10.15.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20421 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging exposes a new JMX bean, named Universal Messaging User Connections, which 
enables access to data related to the number of current sessions that each user has established to 
the server.
You can use the related NumberOfConnections JMX metric and sag_um_connections_per_user Prometheus 
metric for monitoring. The name of each UserConnectionsBean object is the same as the name of the 
user to whom it corresponds.
For more information about the new JMX bean and metrics, see the Universal Messaging Administration 
Guide.

NUM-20419 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

The JMX metrics that Universal Messaging provides, and the respective
Prometheus metrics, have issues related to incorrect data types and usage, and
inconsistent naming and descriptions.
The issues are resolved. All JMX metrics and the Prometheus metrics in the
jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file now have correct and uniform date types, usage,
names, and descriptions.
In addition, you can use the following new JMX metrics and corresponding Prometheus metrics:
JMX metrics
- DirectMemoryMax
- DirectMemoryFree
- DiskTotal
- DiskFree

NUM-20406 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Docker script was using hardcoded wrapper constant in Server_Common.conf, to enable the JMX 
configuration [sed -i "s|\(.*wrapper.java.additional.27.*\)|\wrapper.java.additional.27=-...]
This is easily avoided by getting the last wrapper property index and setting the same config 
dynamically.

NUM-20315 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Xalan library updated from version 2.7.2 to version 2.7.3

NUM-20313 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Bouncy Castle libraries updated from version 1.60 to version 1.70

NUM-20194 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging registers a durable connection bean twice when JMX is enabled
and writes an error in the nirvana.log file.
The issue affects synchronous durable subscribers. The server returns the
following error when a new durable connection bean is registered: "Durable
Connection Bean with the same ID found while registering a new one, unregister
the old one."
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20096 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

The Universal Messaging server now logs additional diagnostic information when
thread-pool monitoring reports purging for a JMS channel that is slow or stalled.
The information includes the name of the channel for which the purge operation is executed,
the duration of the last purge, and the time it takes the server to compile a list of individual 
events eligible for purging.
For clustered channels, the master realm also logs the last requested purgeable EID,
the last lowest purgeable EID received by the slave realms, and the purge request-response time.

NUM-20057 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

When a Universal Messaging cluster is part of a zone, events that are already acknowledged and 
consumed might accumulate on the channels of the zone.
These zone channels have a last acknowledged EID of -1 on the clustered join, which causes the 
backlog of events. In addition, zone channels that are deleted and then recreated can cause the 
clustered join to be ahead of the channel's own last EID. In this situation, events can go missing 
if further publishes are performed through the clustered join.
The issue is resolved. The Universal Messaging server has been modified to correct for such issues. 
In addition, the healthchecker tool of the Realm Information Collector has been enhanced to 
identify joins that are ahead of the channel's last EID.

NUM-20216 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party Xerces library used in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved. The Xerces jar used in Universal Messaging has been upgraded to version 
2.12.1 from versions 2.11 and 2.3.

NUM-20146 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

When the used by customer nodeJS AMQP (Rhea) client was closed- the associated AMQP processing tasks 
were not closed appropriately. This caused high CPU usage caused by UM's server AMQP processing 
threads. Similar high CPU usage was also possible on a idle, non-closed AMQP client connections.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-20093 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

After you import a durable from an XML file, publishing events to the durable might result in lost 
events.
The issue occurs because the start EID of the exported durable is greater than the last EID of the 
associated channel.
The issue is resolved. The Universal Messaging server now resets any durable start EIDs that are 
greater than the channel's last EID to that last EID.
In addition, the following changes have been made:
- The API documentation for com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nDurableAttributes#setStartEID
has been updated to reflect the EID changes.
- You can now import Named durables into a Universal Messaging server.
Previously, com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nDurableAttributes.nDurableType.Named objects could not be 
imported into a Universal Messaging server because a non-null selector was set during export. To 
resolve this issue, selectors are now ignored for Named durables during import because Named 
durables do not support selectors at creation time. For more information, see 
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nDurableAttributes#setSelector.

NUM-20077 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

When the error occurs while parsing the jaas config file during authentication, no error was logged 
until the log level is changed to warning. 
With this fix, such error gets logged in nirvana.log file with default log level (error).

NUM-19991 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party org.json library used in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved. The org.json jar used in Universal Messaging has been upgraded to version 
20230227 from version 20160810.

NUM-19986 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

The Universal Messaging server and Java client now log additional diagnostic information when thread 
pool monitoring reports a slow or stalled task.
Additional information is logged for slow or stalled tasks in the following cases:
- A slow or stalled channel listener task in the Java client. The thread pool monitoring logs the 
channel name and the size of the incoming event queue.
- A slow connection accept task in the server. The thread pool monitoring logs the connection 
details (IP address and port), the type of the client, and connection statistics for the respective 
network interface.
- A slow connection read task in the server. The thread pool monitoring logs the connection details 
(IP address and port), and also minimum, maximum, and current response times for the connection.

NUM-18060 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

When you use the nInstanceManager tool to create a Universal Messaging realm instance, the instance 
gets created, but the tool returns warning messages.
The nInstanceManager tool returns the following messages:
- WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
- WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.reflect.opt.Injector
(file:/opt/softwareag/1011/UniversalMessaging/lib/jaxb-impl-2.3.0.jar) to method

The issue is now resolved.

NUM-20155 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

Before this solution, when the header-fields count exceeded count 30 resulted in 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException.
With this fix, now can process as many header-fields as needed, until it does not cross the 
max-header-buffer-size set.

NUM-20084 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

The jmx_exporter.yaml configuration file, which was deprecated in
Universal Messaging 10.11, has been removed.
Instead, to configure JMX with Universal Messaging, use the replacement file,
jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml.
For more information about using JMX, see the Universal Messaging documentation.

NUM-20047 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

Universal Messaging (UM) clusters within a zone with bi-directional forwarding of events have event 
forwarding and stability issues under high load conditions. 
When the issues occur, the server logs include entries about deadlocks, connection multiplexer IO 
exceptions, and stalled tasks with Join Daemon.
In addition, a UM realm instance in the cluster might cause an increase in CPU usage.
The issues are resolved.

NUM-20017 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

Universal Messaging might reach a state of deadlock when simultaneously attempting to close multiple 
connections due to a read request timeout.?
The issue might occur when the server tries to close the connections of multiple subscribers of 
channels with shared durables.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-19966 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

A Universal Messaging server instance fails to start when the JMX Exporter agent is enabled on the 
AIX operating system. The issue occurs because some special characters in the 
jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file cause encoding issues.
The issue is resolved. 
Note: These changes are only applicable to newly created instance (after applying the fix). For the 
existing instance, one should manually replace the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml in the server's bin 
directory with the one from server's templates directory.

NUM-19915 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

Having many synchronous consumers active on a queue might cause high CPU usage and slow performance 
in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19895 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

A Universal Messaging client might fail to connect to the server with a "backlog exceeded" error.
The client cannot connect to the server and Universal Messaging writes the following
error to the nirvana.log: "Backlog queue exceeded limit, unable to process incoming connection".
In addition, the client might report many slow-moving tasks related to event processing. The issue 
occurs
after installing the fix for NUM-17781 for your Universal Messaging version, which introduces a 
regression.
The issue is resolved. The restriction on the total number of connections being authenticated now 
falls back on
the Connection Monitor to ensure that there are not too many connections being authenticated at the 
same time.
This enforces the limit based on the host from which the connections are coming and not based on the 
total of connections.

NUM-19887 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

Using JMX, you can monitor only one Universal Messaging HTTP-SocketAccept or
HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pool at a time and you cannot identify which thread
pool you are monitoring.
Out of many existing HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pools,
you can monitor only one at a time using JMX and it is not clear which one it is.
The JMX monitoring tool just displays the generic name HTTP-SocketAccept.
The issue happens because the socket accept thread pool name does not include
the name of the corresponding Universal Messaging interface and the JMX server
cannot identify the different thread pools.
The issue is resolved. Now each HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread
pool name includes the name of the corresponding interface, for example,
HTTP-SocketAccept-nhp1, and all thread pools are visible and identifiable in your
JMX monitoring tool.

NUM-17831 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

UM server was not able to handle more then thousand simultaneous MQTT connection gracefully- MQTT 
connect time would increase and MQTT clients might start experiencing connect timeouts.
This is now resolved by optimizing the MQTT connect handling on the server. Depending on the 
environment used, single UM server should be able to handle more then 5000 MQTT connect operations 
simultaneously.
Also UM's ability to work with thousands stores and consumers is also improved.
Following important optimizations were added as part of this fix:
- Durable state saving was optimized by using an buffered output stream, so the save operation is 
performed faster on disk.
- MQTT configuration to configure the EventsPerSpinle channel configuration for auto created topics 
is added:
"Protocol MQTT Config"-> "AutoCreatedStoreSpindleSize". Defaults to 50000. Previously stores were 
created with eventsPerSpindle = 0, which was leading to MQTT auto created stores were created as 
non-multifile stores.
- A ConcurrentModificationException in the nInterestStorageValidator is fixed.
- For single UM server deployment (non-A/A clustering), the duplicate MQTT ClientID detection is 
optimized to not persist connection state on disk.

NUM-19860 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

Universal Messaging (UM) now logs the total time it takes to start or shut down a UM server.

NUM-19834 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

Universal Messaging (UM) now logs information about the interfaces that are added or deleted from a 
UM server in the server logs.

NUM-19794 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

Cluster migration from an older Universal Messaging version to version 10.11 and higher might fail 
with a recovery error.
Some of the cluster nodes remain in recovery mode and Universal Messaging returns the following 
error: " Index recovery can not find the target channel".
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19658 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

Clients version 10.3 and older might fail to receive events from a queue
when they are connected to a slave node in a Universal Messaging cluster.
The issue occurs when a synchronous queue consumer consumes events from the queue.
Under these conditions, the slave might return an array of one event to the synchronous queue 
consumer.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19413 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

Adding or modifying supported ciphers for a Universal Messaging server SSL interface using 
command-line tools might fail.
When you run the AddHTTPSInterface, AddSSLInterface, or ModifyInterface command-line tools and 
specify the 'ciphers' optional parameter, the tools might fail to execute, although the specified 
ciphers are part of the list of supported SSL ciphers. Adding a cipher might fail with the 
following error: "Illegal argument passed: Cipher not found in supported cipher list".
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19227 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

A vulnerability of 3d party component Snakeyaml  in jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar was discovered (as  
Snakeyaml of 1.29 v was used in jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar)
The issue is resolved. The jmx_prometheus_javaagent binary has been upgraded from version 0.16.1 to 
version 0.18.0 (which contains snakeyaml 2.0 - which mitigated the vulnerability).

NUM-18899 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

Universal Messaging might fail to start with an ?event key outside of range for store key? error.
When you start a realm server, Universal Messaging writes the following error message in the 
nirvana.log file: ?Nirvana Realm Server shutting down due to fatal file I/O error occurred: 
MultiFileStore, store file? Key outside of range for store Key?.
The issue is now resolved. 

NUM-17449 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

When using Protobuf messages, UM uses the default Protobuf 3 values. This behavior is now 
configurable via a server side configuration option - TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull . Its default value is 
false to retain the current behavior where unset string fields are treated as empty strings and not 
NULL. To change that behavior and treat unset fields as NULL,  set the configuration value of 
TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull to true. 
One can configure TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull via EnterpriseManager->Realm->Config->Show Advanced 
Config->Advanced Configuration->Protobuf Config->TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull.

NUM-19512 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

When a Universal Messaging (UM) client with version 10.7 or lower connects to a UM server with 
version 10.11 or higher, the session reconnect handlers throw the following nSecurity event: 
"Error: Data Groups/Streams not supported on Server." This error message indicates that Universal 
Messaging version 10.11 or higher does not support Data Groups and Data Streams.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-19450 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

CPU usage in Universal Messaging might spike due to Prometheus monitoring.
When JMX monitoring using Prometheus is enabled in a Universal Messaging server,
CPU usage can reach 99% even during insignificant loads.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now provides an updated jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file in 
the <Software_AG_directory>\UniversalMessaging\sever\templates directory, which limits additional 
queries made by the JMX Exporter agent. For information about how to apply the new file to existing 
server instances, see the topic on monitoring Universal Messaging using Prometheus in the Universal 
Messaging documentation.

NUM-19302 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

When Integration Server uses Universal Messaging as a JMS provider, it might stop responding when 
you try to enable or disable JMS triggers.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19293 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

Creation of an interface when there is an existing interface with the same port was allowed.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-19253 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

Enterprise Manager displays invalid realm property values imported from an XML realm configuration 
file using the ninstancemanager command-line tool.
After you import a realm configuration from an XML file using ninstancemanager and the configuration 
contains invalid realm property values, Universal Messaging might not automatically replace the 
invalid values with valid ones on start-up. As a result, Enterprise Manager displays the invalid 
property values, which could lead to exceptions and unexpected behavior of Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved. 

NUM-19231 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)


NUM-19410 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix5)

Universal Messaging now supports defining the number of concurrent connections per user.
You can use a new realm configuration property, "MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName", part of the 
"Connection Config" group in the Enterprise Manager, to specify the number of concurrent 
connections per user. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of connections. 
Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647. When you set a limit, if connections exceed the 
specified number, the client will get an nSecurityException. However, admin connections with the 
"Realm Override Connection Count" permission are still allowed to connect to the realm server.
In addition, the existing "MaxNoOfConnections" property, controls the total number of concurrent 
connections to the server. When you set a limit on the total number, connections that exceed the 
limit are rejected if they are non-admin connections or if they do not have the "Realm Override 
Connection Count" permission. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of 
connections. Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647.

NUM-19166 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Previously if  protobuf descriptors were updated for the channel on master/slave node, all other 
nodes stayed with old protobuf descriptors. 
And if the master was restarted,  the new master was selected and all nodes again restore old 
protobuf descriptors.
Durable filters were not able to be applied to the event and stopped receiving events at this point.
Now it is fixed and each node of the cluster will update channel protobuf descriptors when it is 
changed in one of the nodes.

NUM-19154 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

ReadPool tasks could be stalled when connections are abruptly closed. This defect manifests itself 
by server log entries such as

This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-19131 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Reintroduced the Id option of the nRealmTool utility to modify the host and port.

NUM-18982 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Fixed a rare deadlock caused by an abnormal close in the Javascript websocket driver. A side effect 
of this deadlock is that a UM server may shutdown and automatically restart.

NUM-18372 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

In a Universal Messaging (UM) cluster that uses multiplexed sessions, the primary realm server 
instance stops responding because of increased CPU usage, which stalls the tasks on the UM server. 
The issue occurs when the multiplexed SSL session between the server and client does not close 
properly.
The issue is resolved.
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: closing inbound before receiving peer's close_notify
The fix for this issue involves correcting and refactoring specific code in the server's NIO layer 
to address the issue.

NUM-19017 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

When you use Software AG Installer to create a Universal Messaging Docker image, the JMX agent port 
does not have a default value. This leads to an incorrect entry  being set in the Universal 
Messaging server configuration file. As a result, the Universal Messaging server fails to start and 
the container exits immediately. 
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-18559 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

After a restart of the master node in a cluster, Universal Messaging might not delete .mem files for 
a channel on a slave node after all events are acknowledged.
Universal Messaging might not delete the .mem files for a multi-file store channel on a slave node 
in a cluster even after all events have been acknowledged. The issue occurs when the channel uses a 
JMS engine and after you edit a storage property for the channel and restart the master node.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18425 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Creating a durable on the JMX server fails with a MalformedObjectNameException.
When you have enabled the JMX server and try to create a durable on a channel, Universal Messaging 
writes a MalformedObjectNameException in the nirvana.log file. The durable gets created on the 
Universal Messaging server, but not on the JMX server. The issue occurs because the JMX beans and 
attributes cannot validate a durable name containing special characters.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-18339 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

A Universal Messaging Java client fails to connect to the server when the hostname of the server or 
of the machine that hosts the server contains special characters, such as an underscore.
The issue occurs because the Java URI API does not support special characters in hostnames.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17944 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

The creation of search rules happens after the escaped characters are identified and marked as such. 
Now it is possible to escape the '%' character because it is not used for splitting the input 
string early in the process anymore and it can be treated as a normal character.

NUM-17909 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

A Universal Messaging realm server logs errors about insufficient disk space even when the free disk 
space is sufficient.
The server logs an error into the nirvana.log file that "Free disk space has reduced below warning 
threshold percentage."
The issue is resolved. Now the server logs an error message only when the free disk space required 
for the realm server to continue processing is below the defined minimum threshold.

NUM-17708 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix3)

Pre-10.7 synchronous clients are not able to retrieve events from a standard, non-durable queue on a 
slave node in a cluster.
The fix for this issue will ensure that window sizes are handled properly for older, pre-10.7 
synchronous clients, while post-10.7 synchronous clients will use the new prefetch API instead.

NUM-18913 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

The Docker image for the Universal Messaging server now supports the log4j2 framework for logging 
and provides a default log4j2 configuration. The default log4j2 configuration does NOT store the 
nirvana.log log file on disk but streams the log output to STDOUT.
You can configure the UM the server logging level, by using the UM Admin API or Enterprise Manager 
after you enable the Log4j2 logging framework for the container.
For more details about log4j2 support in Docker images for Universal Messaging, see the Universal 
Messaging documentation.

NUM-18668 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

When you enable the ThreadDumpOnSlowTask thread-pool monitoring property, Universal Messaging might 
generate many thread dumps over a short time, which could slow performance.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18421 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Universal Messaging might log thread dumps twice in nirvana.log.
When a stalled or slow moving task is detected, or a thread dump is requested, it might be logged 
twice in nirvana.log which is unnecessary.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18890 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

In UM Docker images created via the SAG Installer the logs directory is not present by default in 
the installation and gets created when a container is run. This sets directory's owner to root, 
which makes it inaccessible to the UM server in the container, as it runs as "sagadmin".
This issue is now resolved.

8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation
