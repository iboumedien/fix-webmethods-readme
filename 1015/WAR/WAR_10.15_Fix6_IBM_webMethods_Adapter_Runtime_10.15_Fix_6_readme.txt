When the health end-point of an adapter is accessed, the listener properties
appear including the runtimeState attribute which is a dictionary of key/value

dictionary displays only currentState as disabled which is the state of the
listener set by the user.

PIEAR-2457 (WAR_10.15_Fix2)

PIEAR-2250 (WAR_10.15_Fix1)
BinCoder exceptions/warnings appear in Integration Server logs.

When the whitelist filtering is enabled in Integration Server, then the Java
object is deserialized only if the class appears in the whitelist. The Java class

which resulted in the appearance of the BinCoder exceptions/warnings in
Integration Server logs.

This issue is now resolved
