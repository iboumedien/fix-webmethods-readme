Administrator privileges perform tasks that involve defining and configuring projects, or creating
deployment sets, builds, and maps.

This issue is resolved.

WDY-6433 (DEP_10.15_Fix3)

In the Deployer user interface, the Logs > Audit screen is not displayed with proper formatting.

The issue occurs if the watt.server.http.X-Content-Type-Options extended setting is set to to nosniff

The issue is resolved.


WDY-6417 (DEP_10.15_Fix2)

When using runtime-based deployment to deploy a scheduled service to a target Integration Server, the log shows an error message that the service is not added even when the service has been deployed successfully. 
The issue occurs when the source Integration Server runs on a machine with a user locale that is not English.
The issue is now resolved. The log message indicates correctly that the deployment is successful.

WDY-6416 (DEP_10.15_Fix2)

When managing user permissions for project tasks in Deployer, the "Fetch Groups" field on the Authorize Project page does not display the LDAP/Central user management groups. 
As a result, you cannot authorize groups of this type for a project task.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-6348 (DEP_10.15_Fix2)

Creating a checkpoint for a project in Deployer fails when the project contains more than 2 defined deployment sets and the project is mapped to individual target servers 
for one deployment set and to a target server group for another deployment set.
The issue is resolved. The checkpoint is now created successfully. 

WDY-6379 (DEP_10.15_Fix2)

After you authorize a group of users to perform a task for a specific project in Deployer, the "Resulting users with this Authorization" field in the Deployer user interface 
does not list the authorized users from the group and shows "NONE".
The issue is resolved.

Deployer returns "Access is denied" errors because of the Thumbs.db cache file located in the <IS-install-dir>/IntegrationServer/instances/<IS-instance-name>/packages/WmDeployer/pub/images/ACDL directory.

WDY-6410 (DEP_10.15_Fix2)



WDY-6260 (DEP_10.15_Fix1)

In Deployer, when a runtime-based project gets exported to Project Automator, the "type" attribute is set for the "alias" element, 
which is nested in the "TargetGroup" element in the exported XML file. 
This behavior is not correct and causes a failure when running the exported file in Project Automator.
The issue is now resolved.


WDY-6295 (DEP_10.15_Fix1)

When trying to substitute configuration values using "Configure Build by Assets" or
"Configure Build by Servers", the substituted values for some of the parameters are not saved.
The issue is now resolved. 


WDY-6339 (DEP_10.15_Fix1)

After deployment, Deployer overwrites the start time and overdue settings of the Integration Server (IS) scheduled tasks.
The issue is resolved. 
Now Deployer takes the start time and overdue settings from the source IS server and the task is executed based on these settings.

useJSSE option in Deployer is removed.
