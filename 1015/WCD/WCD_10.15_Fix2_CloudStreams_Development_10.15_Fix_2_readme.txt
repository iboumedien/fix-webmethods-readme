WCD-2129 (WCD_10.15_Fix2)

The Git perspective in Software AG Designer 10.15 is corrupted.

Designer throws an error while opening the Git perspective as it is
corrupted. The issue arises from conflicts between the versions
of the Apache Commons Codec and HttpClient libraries.

This issue is now resolved.

WCD-2086 (WCD_10.15_Fix2)

Previously, a common generic message without much information was being 
displayed to the user in case of an error while importing a provider project.

This issue is resolved. Now, the proper reason for the exception will be 
displayed as part of the message.

WCD-2069 (WCD_10.15_Fix1)

The Unpublish window in the Designer under the CloudStreams Development 
perspective would get stuck in a loop when attempting to unpublish a 
Provider package on the Current or Development server.

This issue was observed due to an exception occurring when clicking the 
'Next' button, as some fields such as Target Server and webMethods.io 
Integration tenants were null, causing the window to get stuck in the loop.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-2048 (WCD_10.15_Fix1)

While editing of cloud connector service, custom parameters from simple 
record type fields are missing.

This issue is now resolved.

WCD-2059 (WCD_10.15_Fix1)

Headers/mappings for multi-authentication enabled connectors were not 
updating correctly when the connection alias was changed from the pool.

This issue is now resolved.

8.0 Installation

Step 1: Install using the Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, 
see the documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: If you have migrated your connector services from a version prior to 
CloudStreams 9.7 and impacted by WST-2213, and you are yet to run the migration
utility as suggested in WST-2213, go to Step 2, else skip Step 2. If you have
created your connector services with a CloudStreams 9.7 or later version, you do
not need to run the migration utility.

Step 2: Run the CloudStreams migration utility (pub.cloudstreams.migration:migrate)
to migrate your old CloudStreams artifacts to the latest version.
For more information on the migration utility, see the Integration Server upgrade 
section in the "Upgrading Software AG Products" guide.



9.0 Uninstallation

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager. For instructions see the 
documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently 
installed fix. This action will revert your installation to the previously 
installed fix. You cannot apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.

product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or
