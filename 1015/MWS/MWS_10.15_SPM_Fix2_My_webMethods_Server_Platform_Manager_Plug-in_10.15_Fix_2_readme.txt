MWS-32666 (MWS_10.15_SPM_Fix2)
When creating My webMetods Server instance using the Command Central
web user interface, the drop-down menu for selecting the database type
does not include PostgreSQL, MySQL EE, and MySQL CE databases, although 
all three types are supported.

The issue is resolved. The web interfaces for creating My webMethods 
Server instances are enhanced to display all supported database types.


MWS-31743 (MWS_10.15_SPM_Fix1)
My webMethods Server nodes might report an "Invalid content was found..."
in the Command Central graphical user interface. This issue occurs when

number and delay period.

The issue is resolved.
