WOK-15389 (WOK_10.7_RuleEngine_Fix3)
Two unnecessary jar files are delivered with the Business Rules package.
When starting up the Business Rules runtime these two jar files will be loaded by the classloader.

WOK-15528 (WOK_10.7_RuleEngine_Fix3)
Deployment of business rules fails with java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: 
com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore$Lambda$172
When deploying a business rules project to one or more Integration Servers, through Hot Deployment 
from My WebMethods Server, or through Deployer, sometimes the deployment fails on one or more 
Integration Servers. The Integration Server error log shows a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: 
com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore$Lambda$172.
This issue has been resolved by replacing the sometimes problematic lambda expression with a 
concrete anonymous class.

WOK-15663 (WOK_10.7_RuleEngine_Fix4)
NullPointerException during rule project builds
When building a rule project with the Asset Build Environment, the build would fail with

This issue is now resolved.

This issue has been resolved.

WOK-16048 (WOK_10.7_RuleEngine_Fix4)
Enable WOK license in 10.7
With Business Rules 10.7, WOK licenses could not be used to install and run Business Rules.
This issue is now resolved and WOK licenses can be used again.

WOK-16486 (WOK_10.7_RuleEngine_Fix8)

Business Rules 10.7 did not support MySQL 8,x Community Edition.
This issue is now resolved.

WOK-16517 (WOK_10.7_RuleEngine_Fix9)
businessrulestargetruntime.isOnline=0 after initial start of WmBusinessRules package
When starting up the WmBusinessRules package for the first time on an Integration Server which 
connects to a MySQL database, the BUSINESSTARGETRUNTIMES.ISONLINE column wrongly contains the value 
0 instead of 1. This can cause Business Rules Hot Deployment to this Integration Server to fail.
This issue is now resolved.

WOK-17935 (WOK_10.7_RuleEngine_Fix12)
Vulnerable 3rd Party Component commons-text used
Business Rules used a vulnerable version of commons-text: CVE-2022-42889.
This issue has been resolved by upgrading commons-text from from v1.8.0 to v1.10.0.

WOK-18920
In the Integration Servers server.log there appears the following message randomly:
A business rules exception occurred. Cannot find rule set with name [XXXX]. 
com.softwareag.rules.runtime.exception.RuleSetDoesNotExistException: Cannot find rule set with name 
[XXXX].
This issue has been resolved.
