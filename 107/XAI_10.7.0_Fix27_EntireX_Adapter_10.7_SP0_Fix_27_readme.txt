7.0   Fix Contents

- EXX-15713 XAI_10.7_Fix27:
   CICS Socket Listener: Internal protocol mismatch during handshake 
   disconnects from host, sends data to the disconnected host (CICS 
   call failed: java.net.SocketException: Socket closed), reconnects 
   to the host and sends the data again.
   The issue is solved now and the data will be send with the lower 
   protocol in the same connection. 






7.1   Resolutions included from earlier Fixes

Fix 21:

- EXX-14892 XAI_10.7_Fix21:
   When suppressing null values of type date (D), setting 
   entirex.marshal.date=null resulted in an error.
   Also, when suppressing null values of numeric/decimal type (I1, 
   I2, I4, N, P) using the suppression mode "Suppress null elements 
   and trim array cells at end containing null elements and zero 
   numbers", zeros in structures/groups or as simple elements were 
   not suppressed.
   These issues are now resolved.


Fix 19:

- EXX-14648 XAI_10.7_Fix19:
   EntireX Adapter: Copy and Paste of Broker ID from and into 
   connections containing double back slashes will replace them at 
   runtime with double forward slashes.  This may cause errors like 
   "Wrong argument to Broker constructor: Invalid Broker ID"
   This issue is resolved now.



- EXX-14730 XAI_10.7_Fix19:
   Passwords are printed to the console in encrypted form.
   With this correction the (encrypted) password is no longer 
   displayed


- EXX-13802 XAI_10.7_Fix19:
   EntireX Application Monitoring Data Collector
   entirex.appmondc.filesperday=yes is specified.
   The new log file was started with a delay and data of the new day 
   was included in the log file of the previous day. No data from 
   the next day should be included in the file for the previous day.

   This issue is resolved now. 


Fix 15:

- EXX-14251 XAI_10.7_Fix15:
   A call to a listener connection with at least one output 
   parameter of type Date leads into the error : EXX 0800 0310 
   "Unsupported field: YearOfEra".
   The issue is now resolved


- EXX-14346 XAI_10.7_Fix15:
   url-style BrokerID starting with uppercase protocol (like SSL://, 
   HTTP:// etc.) was not accepted by validation process. The 
   application hit the error "Invalid Broker ID".
   This is resolved now.
   With this correction the protocol part of url-style BrokerID can 
   be written now case-insensitive.


Fix 5:

- EXX-13064 XAI_10.7_Fix5:
   The Broker ID used for SSL communication may contain a password. 
   The format may look like
   ssl://ipaddress:port?trust_store=trust.jks&key_store=key.jks&key_p
   passwd=thepassword
   How to encrypt the password associated with the key in the config 
   files?
   
   With this correction the Broker ID is checked. If it contains the 
   key_passwd, the password will be encrypted and added to Broker ID 
   with key_passwd_e. In this case key_passwd will be removed.



- EXX-13423 XAI_10.7_Fix5:
   EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT fails in a program called via EntireX CICS 
   Socket Listener if the program is called via CICS DPL. 
   The issue is resolved now. For DPL programs used in EntireX CICS 
   Socket Listener the new option SyncOnReturn must be activated in 
   Adapter resp. RPC Server for CICS Socket listener. 
   NOTE: The Solution requires corrections of CICS Socket Listener 
   on z/OS and EntireX Adapter or RPC Server for CICS Socket 
   Listener and configuration change in either EntireX Adapter or 
   RPC Server for CICS Socket Listener 
   
   With this correction the EntireX Adapter supports a new 
   Connection Parameter for CICS Socket Listener Connections 
   parameters: 
   Sync on Return
   Possible values are true or false (Default).
   The value true triggers that the CICS program is called with the 
   CICS LINK option SYNCONRETURN. 
   
   For the RPC Server for CICS Socket Listener the option can be 
   enabled with the new parameter:
   cics.sl.synconreturn
   Possible values are yes or no (Default). 
   The value yes triggers that the CICS program is called with the 
   CICS LINK option SYNCONRETURN. 
   
   The documentation will be updated accordingly.



- EXX-13467 XAI_10.7_Fix5:
   Editing the date and time patterns on the configuration web page 
   of the EntireX Adapter could add unwanted blanks to these 
   patterns which leads to DateTimeParseExceptions. 
   This issue is resolved now. 


- EXX-13492 XAI_10.7_Fix5:
   Multiple possible output as COBOL channel containers were not 
   processed properly in EntireX Adapter.
   This issue is resolved now.


- EXX-13539 XAI_10.7_Fix5:
   RPC Call may fail with 
   com.softwareag.entirex.dynamicrpc.DynamicRPCException: Wrong Date 
   parameter
   The issue is now resolved


- EXX-13302 XAI_10.7_Fix5:
   EntireX Adapter: Calling a COBOL program fails if last parameter 
   has datatype AV
   The issue is now resolved
