WMDPD-10131(DES_10.7_Process_Fix2)

Metadata Deployment in a Docker Environment
In a standard on-premise installation, process models are created and developed in Designer. When ready, you build and upload the process model. During this process the BPM package is created on the Integration Server and contains the PRT fragment, subscription and other triggers, and quality of service attributes. After the BPM package is generated, the build and upload process inserts or updates all of the required metadata into the process audit schema.
This presents an issue for asset deployment under Docker. While the BPM and other IS packages can be copied to the Docker image, the metadata needed will not be present in the process audit schema in that environment. 


WMDPD-10149(DES_10.7_Process_Fix2)

Building a process model might fail due to a missing null check.

The issue is resolved. 


WMDPD-10134(DES_10.7_Process_Fix2)

Process Developer leaves stale model artifacts when rebuilding models and the upload model files property is disabled.

When a process model is built and uploaded with the "upload model, configuration and image files" property enabled, the files are included in the package. If the model is changed or the version is incremented and the model is rebuilt with the build property disabled, the process artifacts for the original build remain in the package.

The issue is resolved. 


Now the issue is resolved.
