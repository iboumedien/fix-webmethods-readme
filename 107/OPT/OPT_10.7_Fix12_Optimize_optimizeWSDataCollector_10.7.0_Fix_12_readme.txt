1.0 Fix Name

webMethods Optimize optimizeWSDataCollector 10.7.0 Fix 12



2.0 Fix ID

OPT_10.7_Fix12


3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects:

- Web Service Data Collector 10.7


4.0 Requirements

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section
of the Software AG Empower Product Support website at
https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp

For Optimize environments, the fix version of the Optimize component fixes must
be the same as the fix version of Optimize shared components fixes
(wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedLib and wMFix.OPT.optimizeSharedUI).


5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.


6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Attempting to apply the Optimize Fix to an installation where
 MWS is configured to use the embedded Derby database will fail.
 There will be an error reported in the Software AG Update Manager
 log. For all other supported Relational Database Management Systems
 configured for MWS, the fix can be applied successfully.

 There is no workaround at this time.


 2. Software AG does not recommend uninstalling this fix because 
 Optimize or other webMethods products might not work properly.

 To be able to restore your Optimize installation, before you install
 the fix you must back up the Optimize database and your file system.


7.0 Fix Contents


OBE-12448 (OPT_10.7_Fix12)
webMethods Optimize uses an older version of the Jettison library, which has known security vulnerabilities.
 
The issue is resolved. webMethods Optimize now uses Jettison 1.5.4.19.

WMN-8362 (OPT_10.7_Fix12)
In webMethods Monitor, several API queries consume a lot of memory.

The issue is resolved. The following services are modified so that the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter in monitor.cnf applies to them.

pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceList
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListWithFilter
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomDataSet
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomData
pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList

If you set useExactMatch to True, your search query will return only those INSTANCEID,
PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID results which exactly match your search term. An isExactMatch input parameter is also added to these services. isExactMatch works like the useExactMatch parameter, but takes priority over it.

New parameter reference:
  isExactMatch
  
  This parameter allows you to control whether your search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  
Valid values are:
  false - Default value for isExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  true - If you set isExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID. The query will return only those
  results which exactly match your search term.



OBE-12490 (OPT_10.7_Fix11)
webMethods Optimize uses an older version of the JSON library, which has known security vulnerabilities.

  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID.
  true - If you set useExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID. The search query will return only those results
  which exactly match your search term.

The issue is resolved.



OBE-11911 (OPT_10.7_Fix3)
In an Optimize environment, Analytic Engine begins to use a lot of memory and CPU resources whenever process/step control data cannot be processed. This results in degraded performance which might lead to a potential crash.

The issue is resolved.

OBE-11852 (OPT_10.7_Fix3)
In the Define Environments page of Optimize, you cannot delete an environment which uses a PostgreSQL database. When you open the Edit Environment page of such an environment, you cannot use the Map All function more than once.

Analytic Engine.

The issue is resolved.



OBE-11769 (OPT_10.7_Fix2)
Analytic Engine and Web Service Data Collector cannot run behind a load balancer.

The issue is resolved. You can enable Analytic Engine or Web Service Data Collector to work behind a load balancer, by doing the following:
1. Install the OPT_10.5_Fix9 fix.
2. Open the EndpointRegistry.xml file located in:
For Analytic Engine: 
<sag_install_dir>/optimize/analysis/conf/system/
For Web Service Data Collector: 
<sag_install_dir>/optimize/dataCollector/conf/system/
3. Add a new endpoint for the load balancer configuration to each 
EndpointRegistry.xml file you want to modify:
<endpoint host="HOSTNAME" name="LB Registry" path="PATH" port="PORT" protocol="PROTOCOL"/>, 
where:
<host> is the IP address or hostname of the load balancer.
For the <name> parameter, specify "LB Registry".
<path> is the routing path for the listener.
<port> is the port on which to access the load balancer.
<protocol> is the communication protocol to use with the load balancer, for example HTTP or HTTPS.

Important: You must perform the above steps after each deployment of an 
environment configuration from the user interface, 
because the EndpointRegistry.xml file is overwritten.

OBE-11752 (OPT_10.7_Fix2)

result, the dead letter queue might fill with JMS messages. The issue occurs when the JMS message is 
longer than the maximum allowed length.
