of the Software AG Empower Product Support website at
https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp

6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Attempting to apply the Optimize Fix to an installation where
 MWS is configured to use the embedded Derby database will fail.

 configured for MWS, the fix can be applied successfully.

 There is no workaround at this time.


 2. You cannot uninstall this fix using Software AG Update Manager.

 To be able to restore your Optimize installation, before you install
 the fix you must back up the Optimize database and your file system.

OBE-11671 (OPT_10.7_AE_SPM_Fix1)
