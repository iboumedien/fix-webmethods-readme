DeployToCloudException: Could not promote assets when deploying rule project to Cloud Container
When an IS package has been previously deployed to a Cloud Container solution and then a rule 
project is deployed to the same solution, the rule project deployment fails with an 
"DeployToCloudException: Could not promote assets when deploying rule project to Cloud Container" 
error.
This issue has been resolved.

com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore$Lambda$172
When deploying a business rules project to one or more Integration Servers, through Hot Deployment 
from My WebMethods Server, or through Deployer, sometimes the deployment fails on one or more 
Integration Servers. The Integration Server error log shows a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: 
com.softwareag.rules.runtime.pool.EnginePoolStore$Lambda$172.
This issue has been resolved by replacing the sometimes problematic lambda expression with a 
concrete anonymous class.

No Designer error message on Deploy to a solution with a different version
When deploying rule projects from a 10.5 Designer installation to a 10.7 cloud container solution, 
the deployment fails with no error message and no user feedback.
This issue has been resolved by providing an error message, informing the user that the Designer 
installation and the cloud container solution must be on the same version.

WOK-15742 (WOK_10.7_RuleDesigner_Fix3)
Rules can be deployed from Designer to cloud container solution without the WmBusinessRules package

Integration Server to deploy to.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-15751 (WOK_10.7_RuleDesigner_Fix3)
Rules deployment is not tracking in history of Deploy Page
When deploying a rule project from Designer to a cloud container solution, the cloud container 
Solutions - Deploy - History page does not show information about the deployment.
This issue has been resolved.

WOK-16172 (WOK_10.7_RuleDesigner_Fix5)
Missing dependency checks when deploying to Cloud Container
When using Designer to deploy rule projects to Cloud Container,
dependencies to External Event Rules, Process Actions and Predictive Analytics Actions were not 
checked and deployment of such rule projects was not prevented; dependencies to service actions 
were not checked and user was not informed of missing dependencies; dependencies to internal rules 
assets were declared.
This issue has been resolved.
