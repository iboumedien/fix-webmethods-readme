7.0 Fix Contents

WED-10158
Designer throws the "Unrecognized token" error while testing the 
connection to webMethods Cloud Container.

In Designer > Window > Preferences > Software AG > Cloud Container, 
testing the connection to the Cloud Container URL fails with the error.

This issue is now resolved.


WED-9982 (ESB_10.7_Fix5)
In Designer, lines of code disappear while editing a flow service.

In Designer, consider a flow service with multiple steps such as MAP,
INVOKE, and so on under steps such as SEQUENCE and REPEAT. While
editing the flow service using operations such as Move Left and
Move Right, Designer throws an exception that results in missing code.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9721 (ESB_10.7_Fix4)
Designer now provides an option for user to create a consumer REST API 
descriptor using an OpenAPI document that conforms to the OpenAPI 3.0.x 
specification.


WED-9691 (ESB_10.7_Fix4)
Delay in updating complex flow services. 

Updating a flow service with complex pipeline mappings and several document 
references require Designer to constantly communicate with Integration Server 
to reconcile the pipeline mappings, which causes the delay. 

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server reconciles the pipeline mappings. 

Note: 
As the reconciliation logic is removed from Designer, install this Designer 
fix with the corresponding Integration Server fix to resolve the issue.


WEL-139 (ESB_10.7_Fix3)
The Java service editor fails to recognize the external library references in
packages.

Designer excludes the external libraries in the project classpath.
Hence, the Java service editor fails to recognize the external library
references in the packages opened locally for service development.

This issue is now resolved.


WED-9639 (ESB_10.7_Fix3)
Creating a provider REST API Descriptor from a Swagger document fails
with "NullPointerException".

This issue is now resolved.


WED-9507 (ESB_10.7_Fix2)
Designer throws the following exception during cloud deployment.

<java.io.InterruptedIOException: Read timed out after xxx ms>

While deploying assets to a cloud environment, Designer synchronizes assets in
the local (source) repository according to the cloud (target) repository. If the
cloud repository contains more files or large packages, synchronization takes
more time, and the connection timeout happens.

To resolve this issue, a new parameter called "Repository timeout (seconds)" is
added under "Window > Preferences > Software AG > Service Development > Cloud
Deployment". This parameter specifies the connection timeout in seconds between
the cloud and the local repository. The default value is 240 seconds. 


WED-9506 (ESB_10.7_Fix2)
Designer does not support deploying Microservices Runtime assets to cloud.

In Designer > Package Explorer, the context menu for Integration Server assets
displays 'Deploy to Cloud'. This option is not available for Microservices
Runtime assets.

The issue is now resolved.


WED-9529 (ESB_10.7_Fix2)
A security issue with the jQuery library was discovered
in Designer Service Development.

The issue is resolved. The vulnerable version 3.1.1 of the library
is now upgraded to a more secure version (3.6.0). 


WED-9528 (ESB_10.7_Fix2)
A security issue with the Bootstrap library was discovered
in Designer Service Development.

The issue is resolved. The vulnerable version 3.3.7 of the library
is now upgraded to a more secure version (4.6.0).


WED-9323 (ESB_10.7_Fix2)
Designer throws a NullPointerException while comparing identical services between
two Integration Servers.

Designer throws a NullPointerException when you compare a service on one
Integration Server with an identical service on another Integration Server by
right-clicking and selecting "Compare Element(s) With > Other Server > {server_name}",
where {server_name} signifies another connected Integration Server that has the
second service.

This issue is now resolved. 


WED-9315 (ESB_10.7_Fix2)
Designer incorrectly handles the breakpoints of flow steps in the flow editor.

In a flow service, the breakpoint enabled for a MAP or INVOKE step must remain
attached to the step regardless of the modifications to the flow service.
However, when the flow service is modified by adding, deleting, or rearranging
the steps, the breakpoint does not move with the original step in the flow editor,
which is incorrect. Similar behavior is observed in the Debug perspective as
well.

This issue is resolved now. 


WED-9195 (ESB_10.7_Fix1)
While comparing the current version of a flow service in Local Service
Development with a specific revision in the Version Control System, Designer
generates a NullPointerException and does not display the differences.

This issue is now fixed.
