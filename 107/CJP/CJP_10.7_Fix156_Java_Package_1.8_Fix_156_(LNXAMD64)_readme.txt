6.0 Cautions and Warnings

* Since Fix 152: If you are using Kerberos, please ensure that you don't use weak crypto. 
Esp. des3-hmac-sha1 and rc4-hmac Kerberos encryption types (etypes) are disable now:
Deprecation of 3DES and RC4 in Kerberos (from 
https://docs.azul.com/core/pdfs/october-2023/azul-zulu-ca-release-notes-october-2023-rev1.3.pdf )
With JDK-8139348 the des3-hmac-sha1 and rc4-hmac Kerberos encryption types (etypes) are now 
deprecated and disabled by default. To re-enable them, you can either enable all weak crypto 
(which also includes des-cbc-crc and des-cbc-md5) by setting allow_weak_crypto = true in the 
krb5.conf configuration file or explicitly list all the preferred encryption types using the 
default_tkt_enctypes, default_tgs_enctypes, or permitted_enctypes settings.
 

* Since Fix 148: If you plan to use the Software AG Installer to add components or 
products to the existing installation folder, please don't deploy this fix.

* Since Fix 140: Support for RHEL 6 discontinued
Please don't install this fix on Red Hat Enterise Linux 6.

* Since Fix 136: Azul Zulu 8 for Windows is now compiled with 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. This means that it will no longer include the 
mscvr100.dll library provided by the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 
Redistributable Package (x86/x64), which was included by default in earlier builds. 
Software AG has ensured that this DLL is not used by our Applications but if 
customer applications are depend on the presence of mscvr100.dll in the JDK/JRE 
they will fail to run with the new Azul Zulu 8 builds.
There are two possible workarounds for this problem:
 - Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package.
 - Rebuild the application using a modern version of Visual Studio.

* Since Fix 134: In Azul Zulu JDK TLS 1.0/1.1 is disabled. 
This may cause incompatibility issues if your application uses TLS 1.0/1.1. 

* Since Fix 134: Please check that no other Java versions can be found in your PATH
and LIBRARY PATH (UNIX only) settings.
Also JAVA_HOME should not be set.
 
* Since release: All files in the "<installDir>/jvm/jvm" folder will be set to original vendor 
content. Manual changes in the "<installDir>/jvm/jvm" folder need to be redone after the 
fix install. The old files can be found for reference in the "<installDir>/jvm/jvmXXX.bck" folder.



7.0 Fix Contents

Software AG Java Package (folder "<installDir>/jvm/jvm"), including 
* Azul Zulu JDK 8.78 (openjdk version "1.8.0_412") for Windows, Linux x86_64 and Solaris
  (the GA delivery of 10.7 contained Azul Zulu JDK 8.47 (openjdk version "1.8.0_261") for these platforms).
