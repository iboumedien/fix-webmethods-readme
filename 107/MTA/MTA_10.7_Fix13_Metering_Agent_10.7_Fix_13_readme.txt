the metering license is not present. If you cannot start the webMethods
product, you can temporarily revert its license to the previous version.

enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.

for the release.
