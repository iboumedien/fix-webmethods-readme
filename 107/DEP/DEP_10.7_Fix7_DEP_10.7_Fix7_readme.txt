5.0 Fix Contents

WDY-6246

In Deployer, when a runtime-based project gets exported to Project Automator, the "type" attribute is set for the "alias" element,
which is nested in the "TargetGroup" element in the exported XML file. 
This behavior is not correct and causes a failure when running the exported file in Project Automator.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6448

When the "Reload Packages" option is set to "Yes" for a runtime-based deployment project, 
Deployer reloads the deployed packages twice after deploying them to the target Integration Server.
The issue is resolved. Now Deployer reloads the deployed packages once.

WDY-6400

WDY-6348 (DEP_10.7_Fix6)

Creating a checkpoint for a project in Deployer fails when the project contains more than 2 defined deployment sets and the project is mapped to individual target servers 
for one deployment set and to a target server group for another deployment set.
The issue is resolved. The checkpoint is now created successfully. 

WDY-6271 (DEP_10.7_Fix5)

The Deployer fixes include an older version of the apigateway-deployer.jar instead of the latest version.
The issue is now resolved. 

WDY-6349 (DEP_10.7_Fix5)

After migrating Deployer from version 10.3 to 10.7, the simulation and deployment reports do not get generated when connecting over an HTTPS port.
The issue is now resolved

WDY-6286 (DEP_10.7_Fix4)

When trying to substitute configuration values using "Configure Build 
by Assets" or "Configure Build by Servers", the substituted values for 
some of the parameters are not saved.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6211 (DEP_10.7_Fix3)

Running the Project Automator script fails with an error when using the 
<pwdHandle> element in the Project Automator XML file.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6177 (DEP_10.7_Fix3)

After you update Deployer with fix DEP_10.7_Fix2, Project Automator fails 
with an exception when creating a deletion set.

WDY-6142 (DEP_10.7_Fix2)

Running Project Automator fails with an error when the Project Automator 
XML file contains assets that have dashes in the name.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-6038 (DEP_10.7_Fix2)

Deploying a project that contains an email port fails with an exception.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6096 (DEP_10.7_Fix2)

Project Automator fails with a SAXParseException, when the exported 
Project Automator XML file contains target groups.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-6020 (DEP_10.7_Fix2)

During the partial deployment of a package, the Project Automator script 
takes over 2 hours to complete the script execution, which results in memory 
issues.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-6035 (DEP_10.7_Fix2)

When simulating a deployment or deploying a project with multiple servers defined 
in the IS target group, Deployer does not generate a report in the deployment 
history.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-6083 (DEP_10.7_Fix2)

When a flow service that requires an ACL is added to a deployment project (with 
"Add" selected as the option to resolve the dependencies for the ACL) the 
deployment simulation fails with an error. The issue occurs when audit logging is 
enabled.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-6059 (DEP_10.7_Fix2)

When the trigger thread is locked by a process instance during the execution of a 
runtime deployment, the deployment report is generated without content and a 
timestamp.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-5654 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

In the Deployer user interface, the audit log on the Log > Audit screen 
is not displayed with proper formatting.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-5840 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

The progress report in the Deploy tab of the Deployer UI is empty.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5869 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When simulating a deployment or deploying composites with the same name, 
the message "Artifacts delivered successfully" is skipped for some of the 
assets in the simulation/deployment report.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5904 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When the XML file of Project Automator contains an API Gateway configuration 
with a password handle, the Project Automator creates the API Gateway server 
with an invalid password.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-5938 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When deploying to target Integration Servers, the Integration Server port might 
stop responding, because several of the deployed packages get reloaded.
The issue is resolved. When the "Reload Packages" setting for runtime-based 
deployment is set to "Yes", Deployer sends an additional parameter in the pipeline 
("reloadPackage=true") and the "packagesReload" service is not called.

WDY-5902 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When specifying secure ports (HTTPS) in the Project Automator XML file,
the script fails with an error.

The issue is resolved. You can now create a project with secure ports for servers 
with the new '-useSSL' command line parameter. To configure secure ports, use the 
following syntax for the Project Automator command:
{projectAutomator.bat|projectAutomatorUnix.sh|projectAutomatorMac.sh}
full_path_to_XML_file -useSSL

WDY-5971 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When deploying a project with more than two deployment sets, only a subset of the 
packages get deployed to the target server.
The issue is resolved.

WDY-5965 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

After a message trigger gets deleted, Deployer does not delete the durable associated 
with the trigger from a Universal Messaging (UM) deployment set when deploying 
packages to a target Integration Server. You can only delete the UM durables manually.

The issue is resolved. Now you can configure a new package property, named "Delete 
Universal Messaging Durable" to control whether Deployer deletes durables from UM 
deployment sets automatically.
To configure the new package property, go to Deployment Sets > Packages and click 
the name of the package. In the "<package_Name> properties" area, set "Package Type" 
to "Full" and "Action After Deployment" to "Activate". The "Delete Universal Messaging 
Durable" radio button will then show in the "Package Deployment Options" area. The 
default value is "No" and indicates that Deployer does not delete the UM durables. To 
configure Deployer to delete UM durables, set the value to "Yes".
Note that if "Package Type" and "Action After Deployment" are set to any other value, 
the new property does not show in the "Package Deployment Options" area.

WDY-5860 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

Deployer fails to export the variable substitution for a project that has the same IS 
package in the deployment and deletion sets and returns the following error message: 
'Unable to export variable substitution information.'
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5858 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

Deployer displays the following error message for some assets in a repository-based 
deployment scenario: "Comparison method violates its general contract!". Deployer 
returns the error message when creating the Checkpoint for some assets in a 
repository-based deployment scenario, or when transactional deployment is enabled.

This issue is resolved.

WDY-5731 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When adding resources to a deployment set, the Deployer graphic user interface displays 
frequent NullPointerExceptions and error messages that the server is unavailable.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5903 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

After deployment, Deployer overwrites the start time and overdue settings of the 
Integration Server (IS) scheduled tasks.
The issue is resolved. Now Deployer takes the start time and overdue settings from the 
source IS server and the task is executed based on these settings.

WDY-5954 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

The Deployer user interface now has a new icon, from which you can access the new 
Integration Server asset type for the Email SMPT Server resource.

WDY-5964 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When creating the Deployer builds with Project Automator, Deployer creates too many 
sessions.
This issue is resolved.

WDY-5967 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

In a repository-based deployment project, Deployer attempts to set up a file polling 
port before the related package is installed, which is not the correct order of 
deploying.
The issue is now resolved.

WDY-6012 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

When configuring a Broker Server in Deployer, the list of server versions includes 
version 10.7. The behavior is incorrect, because the highest release version of 
webMethods Broker is 10.5.
The issue is resolved. Now the Deployer user interface only lists 10.5 or lower as 
valid versions for a Broker Server.

WDY-6046 (DEP_10.7_Fix1)

The Deployer.{sh|bat} script fails to run in a webMethods Microservices Runtime 
environment.
The issue is now resolved.
