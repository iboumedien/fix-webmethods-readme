EEO-3908 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix15)

While validating a signed MDN, the module generates an incorrect
message digest if the multipart message has the "Date" header, and
fails with the following error:
"Digest does not match"

This issue is resolved. The module now handles the "Date" header
in multipart messages and successfully validates the signed MDN without
any failure.

Note: For webMethods suite 10.2 installation, you should install
Trading Networks Server 10.2 Fix 1 or higher.

EEO-3917 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix15)

This module generates an MDN with 
"AS2-Version: %/mimeHeader_Org/AS2-Version%" header for an incoming 
EDIINT message that has an AS2-Version header in lower-case. For 
example, "as2-version: 1.1".

This issue occurs due to the case-sensitive checks performed on the 
AS2-Version headers of the incoming EDIINT messages.

This issue is resolved. The module now handles the incoming EDIINT 
messages with AS2-Version headers in lower-case or upper-case 
accordingly and generates an MDN with the correct "AS2-Version" header.  

EEO-3787 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix14)

Integration Server Administrator has a new user interface.

The HTML-based utility that administers IBM webMethods EDIINT Module

The com.wm.util.coder.IDataBinCoder class does not load the EDIINT document 
type classes.

This issue is resolved. A configuration file is added to the required EDIINT
document type classes that are whitelisted.  

EEO-3596 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix13)

If IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT receives a duplicate EDIINT 
document and the partner requests for ASYNC MDN, then EDIINT 
Module incorrectly sets the user status to "ProcessMSG:ERROR" 
instead of "ProcessMSG:IGNORED" and processes the payload. 

This issue is resolved. The module now sets the user status to 
"ProcessMSG:IGNORED" for a duplicate EDIINT document and skips 
the payload processing for both, SYNC and ASYNC MDN requests.

EEO-3601 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix13)

IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT startup and shutdown fails with 
an exception while starting Integration Server or while reloading 
the EDIINT package.

In IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT, after migrating the database 
from 7.x or 8.x to 8.2.1, some field names (for example- Compressed) 
remain unchanged. 

This issue is resolved.

EEO-3446 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix12)

IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT overrides and registers the default 
content handler or coder for the multipart/related content type 
in Integration Server. This causes any message using this content 
type by other modules to send it to EDIINT module by Integration 
Server. 

This issue is resolved. Now, IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT does 
not use the multipart/related content type intended for other 
modules.

EEO-3389 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix11)

In IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT, when EDIINT receive service 
receives the MDN payloads, an exception occurs in the processMDN 
service and displays the following error message:
"Object has been closed"

This issue occurs when Trading Networks closes a connection
before the completion of a query.

This issue is now resolved.

EEO-3268 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix10)

IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT does not support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2
for the outbound AS2 delivery.

This issue occurs because the wm.EDIINT.delivery:deliveryDocument 
service does not use the server property, 
"watt.net.ssl.client.useJSSE" when you invoke the pub.client:http 
service.

This issue is now resolved. IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT supports 
TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 based on the server property, 
"watt.net.ssl.client.useJSSE" for the outbound AS2 delivery.  

EEO-3242 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix10)

Integration Server Administrator has a new look and feel.

In IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT, the AS2 Restart feature displays 
the following exception if the Etag value contains double quotes:
java.io.FileNotFoundException

This issue is now resolved. The AS2 Restart feature does not 
display an exception if the Etag value contains double quotes. 

EEO-3226 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix9)

IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT throws "Digest does not match" error
while receiving an MDN message.

The issue occurs because Module for EDIINT sets the value of the
"signed-receipt-micalg" parameter in
"Disposition-notification-options" of the EDIINT Document to
"SHA-1". Whereas, older implementations of SMIME agents only
recognize "sha1". To ensure backward compatibility with older
SMIME agents, the module must set the value to "sha1" instead of
"SHA-1".

The issue is resolved. Now, IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT sets the
value of "signed-receipt-micalg" parameter to "sha1" instead of
"SHA-1". 

EEO-3222 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix9)

Integration Server 9.9 using Update Manager,
a warning message is displayed stating that "IS_CL_8.2_SP2_Fix18"
is required for the installed fix. This issue occurs because the
fix packages for IBM webMethods Module 8.2 SP1 for EDIINT depend on
Integration Server fix IS_CL_8.2_SP2_Fix6 or later.

NOTE: When installing IBM webMethods Module 8.2 SP1 for EDIINT Fix 1

Integration Server.   

EEO-3194 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix8)

In IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT, when receiving an AS2 message
the following error is displayed:
"Missing Message-ID"

This issue occurs when AS2 message along with the url query
parameters are passed in the request. The EDIINT content handler
cannot not process the AS2 message.

This issue is resolved. Now, the EDIINT content handler processes
the AS2 messages along with the url query parameters. 

EEO-3164 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix7)

In IBM webMethods Module 8.2 for EDIINT, AES-128, AES-192, and

Integration Server can initialize the package in lesser time.

EEO-3008 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix5)

IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT incorrectly sets optional input 
parameters as mandatory. 

The optional input parameters for the wm.EDIINT:send and 
wm.EDIINT:receive services are set as mandatory. 
  
This issue is resolved.

EEO-3026 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix5)

The wm.EDIINT:receive service throws a NullPointerException when 
IBM webMethods Module 8.2 SP1 for EDIINT receives a AS1 transaction. 

This issue is resolved.

In IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT, the wm.EDIINT:receive 
service returns output parameters that are redundant. 

This issue is resolved.

EEO-2934 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix3)

In IBM webMethods Module 8.2 SP1 for EDIINT, changing the Execute
ACL value for the wm.EDIINT:receive service is not possible.

In IBM webmethods module for EDIINT, when you attempt to change the 
Execute ACL value for the wm.EDIINT:receive service,
the module returns the following error:
"WmEDIINT/wm.EDIINT:receive: [ISS.0081.9002]
Cannot perform operation without Write ACL privileges on
wm.EDIINT:receive". The issue occurs because the 
Write ACL of the service has been set as WmPrivate.

The issue is resolved. A new property, 
wm.EDIINT.receiveExecuteACL,is introduced to change the
Execute ACL value. Valid values are any valid ACL groups 
present in the system. There is no default value. 

To configure the property

1. In IBM My webMethods, go to Administration > Integration >
B2B Settings > Configure Properties.

2. In the Module for EDIINT Configuration Properties panel,
specify values for the property.

Note: After configuring wm.EDIINT.receiveExecuteACL, you
must reload the WmEDIINT package to update the Execute ACL value.


EEO-2914 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix2)
Duplicate MDN's are being ignored in Module for EDIINT.

For any sent message, the Module for EDIINT always expects a 
single MDN to be processed, and it ignores any further MDNs 
for the same message. But some user scenarios require the 
module to process duplicate MDNs, for example, if an error 
occurs and the MDN is not processed properly. With this 
fix, a new property, wm.EDIINT.allowProcessingOfDuplicateMDN, 
has been introduced to enable the module to handle duplicate 
MDNs. By default, this property is set to "false". 
To be able to process the duplicate MDNs, set the property 
to "true".

After wm.EDIINT.allowProcessingOfDuplicateMDN is set to "true", 
every incoming duplicate MDN is processed until an MDN is 
processed successfully (Bizdoc attribute EDIINT MDN Disposition 
is set to "processed" for incoming MDN). After an MDN is 
processed successfully, all of the following duplicate MDNs 
will be ignored. 


EEO-2849 (EDI_8.2.1_WmEDIINT_Fix1)
In IBM webMethods Module 8.2 SP1 for EDIINT, the receive 
functionality does not work as expected.

In IBM webMethods Module for EDIINT,the receive functionality 
does not work as expected when the user changes, clones, or
uses a remote alias for the wm.EDIINT:receive service.

This issue is resolved. When the user uses a URL other than 
wm.EDIINT:receive, a new property, wm.EDIINT.receiverURLs, 
must be configured. The new URL(s) must be appended to the 
value of this property. 

New property reference: 
wm.EDIINT.receiverURLs A comma-separated list of URLs.
The default is /invoke/wm.EDIINT/receive.
Note: The new URLs must be appended to the default URL,
for example, 
wm.EDIINT.receiverURLs=/invoke/wm.EDIINT/receive,
/invoke/EDIINT_AS2/clone_Service
