6.0 Cautions and Warnings

It is strongly advisable that the Universal Messaging client libraries
are patched together with the realm server binaries, and that both are kept
up to date with latest Universal Messaging official fix set.


7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.
 	
This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.

NUM-23813 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

Universal Messaging uses the Protobuf library version 3.21.12, which has a security vulnerability.
The issue is resolved. The Protobuf library has been updated to version 3.25.5.

NUM-23628 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

The log level for the specific message Flow Control enabled for Connection with ID has been changed 
from warn to debug to reduce the amount of non-critical log entries in the nirvana.log file. This 
adjustment helps clean up the logs, making them easier to read and understand, while still 
providing detailed Flow Control information at the debug level when needed for troubleshooting.

NUM-23601 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

After a restart of the master node in a cluster, Universal Messaging might not delete .mem files for 
a channel on a slave node after all events are acknowledged.
Universal Messaging might not delete the .mem files for a multi-file store channel on a slave node 
in a cluster even after all events have been acknowledged. The issue occurs when the channel uses a 
JMS engine and after you edit a storage property for the channel and restart the master node.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23226 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix23)

In Universal Messaging, events may accumulate on the source side of a remote join.
The issue may occur when you reuse or disconnect the remote join, and the last EID of the source 
channel has a large value.
Specifically, the issue may happen during the following situation:
1. You delete the remote join using the admin API or the Enterprise Manager, or you disconnect the 
join from the destination server for a long time.
2. Many publishers to the source channel modify the last EID of the channel.
3. You recreate or reconnect the remote join.
The issue is resolved. In addition, you can use a new realm configuration property, 
"RemoteJoinContextStatsInterval", to log join statistics at a specified interval in milliseconds. 
You configure the property on the Config tab for a realm in the Enterprise Manager, as part of the 
Join Config property group. A value between 0 (default) and less than 5000 disables logging. The 
minimum logging interval is 5000.
For more information about working with realm configuration properties, see the Universal Messaging 
documentation.

NUM-21545 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix22)

Updated bouncycastle libraries to 1.78.1 to address security vulnerabilities.

NUM-21442 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix22)

Super users on remote hosts can bypass mandatory authentication regardless of the validity of their 
credentials.
The issue is now resolved. Only super users on localhost are exempt from authentication.

NUM-21335 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix22)

On the Windows platform JVM's do not support millisecond resolution when using the 
java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport#parkNanos methods causing delays up to 15 milliseconds when 
expecting only 1 millisecond. A solution has been implemented that overcomes this issue by enabling 
1 millisecond clock resolution with the use of java.lang.Thread#sleep(long) on a thread for the 
life of the JVM.

NUM-21032 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix21)

When updating protobuf descriptor for the channel and then cluster (all servers) is fully restarted 
the channel missed the new updated protobuf descriptor. 
Now it should be fixed.

NUM-20889 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix21)

AMQP keep alives from a UM server may cause a decode-error during transport, or the idle timeout 
threshold may be missed due to improper keep alive processing on a UM server, causing an AMQP 
client to disconnect and close.
This issue is now resolved. AMQP clients should now remain connected unless gracefully shutdown, or 
the idle timeout threshold (if applicable) is exceeded after proper keep alive processing.

NUM-20952 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

When you close all consumers that are subscribed to a durable, the server logs a 
NullPointerException.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20934 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party org.json library used in Universal Messaging 
[version 20230227].
This issue is resolved by upgrading org.json jar used in Universal Messaging from version 20230227 
to version 20231013.

NUM-20924 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

UM previously supported only filters like: 'document.field = stringField',
but did not support filters like 'stringField=document.field', i.e. where RHS expression of filter 
contains document nested fields.
Now it is fixed and nested fields can be used in right hand side of  filter expression (for now 
except boolean fields values).

NUM-18246 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix19)

Added audit logs on important operations.

NUM-16156 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix19)

Universal Messaging does not provide an option to export Protobuf
definitions from a channel or queue.
The Protobuf definitions are needed when you want to explore
the structure of a payload in a client application or when you
import or export the contents of a channel or queue.
The issue is resolved. Now you can export Protobuf definitions
from a channel or queue in the following ways:
- Using a new command-line tool named ExportProtobufDefinitions.
- Using the Enterprise Manager. A new option, Export Protobuf Definitions,
has been added to the context menu for a channel or queue.
In addition, the ExportRealmXML and ImportRealmXML command-line tools
also have options for exporting and importing Protobuf definitions, respectively.

NUM-20637 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

In a Universal Messaging cluster, a slave node might fail to redirect a client application to the 
master node because the nodes fail to exchange information about the public connections during the 
formation of the cluster.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-20547 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

A Universal Messaging queue synchronous reader waits additional 300 seconds to process an event 
instead of two seconds. The issue is resolved.

NUM-20310 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

Bouncy Castle libraries updated from version 1.60 to version 1.70

NUM-19439 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

AMQP framing/decode errors are possible on the client side due to a possible race condition in the 
QPID Proton J library.
To resolve these errors, the server must synchronize access to a 
org.apache.qpid.proton.engine.Transport for all instances where frames could be written.

NUM-19236 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

Xalan library updated from version 2.7.2 to version 2.7.3

NUM-20215 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party Xerces library used in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved. The Xerces jar used in Universal Messaging has been upgraded to version 
2.12.1 from versions 2.11 and 2.3.

NUM-19990 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

A vulnerability was discovered in the third-party org.json library used in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved. The org.json jar used in Universal Messaging has been upgraded to version 
20230227 from version 20160810.

NUM-19228 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

A vulnerability of 3d party component Snakeyaml  in jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar was discovered (as  
Snakeyaml of 1.29 v was used in jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar)
The issue is resolved. The jmx_prometheus_javaagent binary has been upgraded from version 0.16.1 to 
version 0.18.0 (which contains snakeyaml 2.0 - which mitigated the vulnerability).

NUM-18259 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

A Universal Messaging client might fail to connect to the server with a "backlog exceeded" error.
The client cannot connect to the server and Universal Messaging writes the following
error to the nirvana.log: "Backlog queue exceeded limit, unable to process incoming connection".
In addition, the client might report many slow-moving tasks related to event processing. The issue 
occurs
after installing the fix for NUM-17781 for your Universal Messaging version, which introduces a 
regression.
The issue is resolved. The restriction on the total number of connections being authenticated now 
falls back on
the Connection Monitor to ensure that there are not too many connections being authenticated at the 
same time.
This enforces the limit based on the host from which the connections are coming and not based on the 
total of connections.

NUM-17830 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix17)

UM server was not able to handle more then thousand simultaneous MQTT connection gracefully- MQTT 
connect time would increase and MQTT clients might start experiencing connect timeouts. 
This is now resolved by optimizing the MQTT connect handling on the server. Depending on the 
environment used, single UM server should be able to handle more then 5000 MQTT connect operations 
simultaneously.
Also UM's ability to work with thousands stores and consumers is also improved.
Following important optimizations were added as part of this fix:
- Durable state saving was optimized by using an buffered output stream, so the save operation is 
performed faster on disk.
- MQTT configuration to configure the EventsPerSpinle channel configuration for auto created topics 
is added:
"Protocol MQTT Config"-> "AutoCreatedStoreSpindleSize". Defaults to 50000. Previously stores were 
created with eventsPerSpindle = 0, which was leading to MQTT auto created stores were created as 
non-multifile stores.
- Durable config was added to enable\disable the Consumer State Monitor.
In case of many consumers, the consumer state monitor used for monitor consumer's health might add 
an additional overhead which can affect the performance of the UM server's Scheduler Pool.
"DurableConfig"->"EnableConsumerStateMonitor". Default value is true, to disable the consumer 
monitor set the value to false.
- A ConcurrentModificationException in the nInterestStorageValidator is fixed.
- For single UM server deployment (non-A/A clustering), the duplicate MQTT ClientID detection is 
optimized to not persist connection state on disk.

NUM-19891 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

Using JMX, you can monitor only one Universal Messaging HTTP-SocketAccept or
HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pool at a time and you cannot identify which thread
pool you are monitoring.
Out of many existing HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread pools,
you can monitor only one at a time using JMX and it is not clear which one it is.
The JMX monitoring tool just displays the generic name HTTP-SocketAccept.
The issue happens because the socket accept thread pool name does not include
the name of the corresponding Universal Messaging interface and the JMX server
cannot identify the different thread pools.
The issue is resolved. Now each HTTP-SocketAccept or HTTP-SSLSocketAccept thread
pool name includes the name of the corresponding interface, for example,
HTTP-SocketAccept-nhp1, and all thread pools are visible and identifiable in your
JMX monitoring tool.

NUM-19414 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

Adding or modifying supported ciphers for a Universal Messaging server SSL interface using 
command-line tools might fail.
When you run the AddHTTPSInterface, AddSSLInterface, or ModifyInterface command-line tools and 
specify the 'ciphers' optional parameter, the tools might fail to execute, although the specified 
ciphers are part of the list of supported SSL ciphers. Adding a cipher might fail with the 
following error: "Illegal argument passed: Cipher not found in supported cipher list".
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19220 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix15)

Having many synchronous consumers active on a queue might cause high CPU usage and slow performance 
in Universal Messaging.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19468 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Adding a consumer to a UM Store leaves the sub-name field in the Connections tab empty.
Issue is resolved.

NUM-19452 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

CPU usage in Universal Messaging might spike due to Prometheus monitoring.
When JMX monitoring using Prometheus is enabled in a Universal Messaging server,
CPU usage can reach 99% even during insignificant loads.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now provides an updated jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file in 
the <Software_AG_directory>\UniversalMessaging\sever\templates directory, which limits additional 
queries made by the JMX Exporter agent. For information about how to apply the new file to existing 
server instances, see the topic on monitoring Universal Messaging using Prometheus in the Universal 
Messaging documentation.

NUM-19430 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Universal Messaging now supports defining the number of concurrent connections per user.
You can use a new realm configuration property, "MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName", part of the 
"Connection Config" group in the Enterprise Manager, to specify the number of concurrent 
connections per user. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of connections. 
Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647. When you set a limit, if connections exceed the 
specified number, the client will get an nSecurityException. However, admin connections with the 
"Realm Override Connection Count" permission are still allowed to connect to the realm server.
In addition, the existing "MaxNoOfConnections" property, controls the total number of concurrent 
connections to the server. When you set a limit on the total number, connections that exceed the 
limit are rejected if they are non-admin connections or if they do not have the "Realm Override 
Connection Count" permission. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of 
connections. Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647.

NUM-19300 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

When Integration Server uses Universal Messaging as a JMS provider, it might stop responding when 
you try to enable or disable JMS triggers.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-19232 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)


NUM-19200 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

ReadPool tasks could be stalled when connections are abruptly closed. This defect manifests itself 
by server log entries such as 
[Mon Jul 11 10:37:55.294 CEST 2022] [UM-Monitor-Thread] ThreadPool: <ReadPool> Stalled task found, 
Thread ReadPool:86 has been active for 61500(ms) running task class 
com.pcbsys.foundation.drivers.fServerHTTPDriver$OpenConnection, Idle Threads 89, Allocated Threads 
100, Queued Tasks 0, Task Executed 1807968920
This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-19163 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Previously if  protobuf descriptors were updated for the channel on master/slave node, all other 
nodes stayed with old protobuf descriptors. 
And if the master was restarted,  the new master was selected and all nodes again restore old 
protobuf descriptors.
Durable filters were not able to be applied to the event and stopped receiving events at this point.
Now it is fixed and each node of the cluster will update channel protobuf descriptors when it is 
changed in one of the nodes.

NUM-19151 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Enterprise Manager displays invalid realm property values imported from an XML realm configuration 
file using the ninstancemanager command-line tool.
After you import a realm configuration from an XML file using ninstancemanager and the configuration 
contains invalid realm property values, Universal Messaging might not automatically replace the 
invalid values with valid ones on start-up. As a result, Enterprise Manager displays the invalid 
property values, which could lead to exceptions and unexpected behavior of Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved. 

NUM-18514 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

In a Universal Messaging (UM) cluster that uses multiplexed sessions, the primary realm server 
instance stops responding because of increased CPU usage, which stalls the tasks on the UM server. 
The issue occurs when the multiplexed SSL session between the server and client does not close 
properly.
The issue is resolved.
javax.net.ssl.SSLException: closing inbound before receiving peer's close_notify
The fix for this issue involves correcting and refactoring specific code in the server's NIO layer 
to address the issue.

NUM-18479 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix14)

Reintroduced the Id option of the nRealmTool utility to modify the host and port.

NUM-19578 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

Fixed a rare deadlock caused by an abnormal close in the Javascript websocket driver. A side effect 
of this deadlock is that a UM server may shutdown and automatically restart.

NUM-18339 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix13)

A Universal Messaging Java client fails to connect to the server when the hostname of the server or 
of the machine that hosts the server contains special characters, such as an underscore.
The issue occurs because the Java URI API does not support special characters in hostnames.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18668 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

When you enable the ThreadDumpOnSlowTask thread-pool monitoring property, Universal Messaging might 
generate many thread dumps over a short time, which could slow performance.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18421 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix12)

Universal Messaging might log thread dumps twice in nirvana.log.
When a stalled or slow moving task is detected, or a thread dump is requested, it might be logged 
twice in nirvana.log which is unnecessary.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18475 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix11)

Creating a durable on the JMX server fails with a MalformedObjectNameException.
When you have enabled the JMX server and try to create a durable on a channel, Universal Messaging 
writes a MalformedObjectNameException in the nirvana.log file. The durable gets created on the 
Universal Messaging server, but not on the JMX server. The issue occurs because the JMX beans and 
attributes cannot validate a durable name containing special characters.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-18197 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

Universal Messaging continuously writes NullPointerExceptions to the nirvana.log file, which 
originate from the JMX context.
The issue occurs if you create a secure interface and do not specify correct certificate attributes.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18121 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

Improve the performance of cluster pipeline processing by using a different data structure.

NUM-18111 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

The performance of a Universal Messaging server might deteriorate when a durable or a queue has many 
outstanding events.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16036 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix10)

When Universal Messaging is configured to use the Logback framework, rolling the logs might fail 
with an exception.
When rolling the logs on a Windows operating system, if the Logback framework fails to rename a log 
file, it throws a NullPointerException.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now supports version 1.2.11 of the Logback framework.

NUM-17870 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix9)

Universal Messaging audit logging for cluster operations has been enhanced.
The server now creates audit logging events for each cluster operation depending
on whether the 'RealmSuccess' audit realm configuration property or 'RealmFailure'
audit realm configuration property is set to 'true'.
In addition, Universal Messaging logs connection details and information about
the user who performs the following actions:
- Creates a cluster
- Adds a member to a cluster
- Removes a member from a cluster
- Destroys a cluster
For more information about the 'RealmSuccess' and 'RealmFailure' properties and server
audit logging, see the Universal Messaging documentation.

NUM-17909 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix8)

A Universal Messaging realm server logs errors about insufficient disk space even when the free disk 
space is sufficient.
The server logs an error into the nirvana.log file that "Free disk space has reduced below warning 
threshold percentage."
The issue is resolved. Now the server logs an error message only when the free disk space required 
for the realm server to continue processing is below the defined minimum threshold.

NUM-17790 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix8)

Universal Messaging now supports flat namespaces for topics and queues in the JMX server bean. When 
you enable the new functionality, a JMX queue namespace, for example, will have the format 
"destinationName=/q1/q2/q3".
By default, JMX namespaces for topics and queues are created using a folder tree structure, for 
example, "Folder1=q1,Folder2=q2,destinationName=queuename", which might cause issues for some 
monitoring solutions.
To enable the flat namespace functionality, you must set to ?true? a new realm configuration 
property, ?FlatStoreJMXBeanNamespace", as part of the JVM management configuration for a realm. To 
switch to flat namespaces, take the following steps:
1. In Enterprise Manager, select a realm and go to Config > JVM Management.
2. Set the "FlatStoreJMXBeanNamespace" property to ?true?.
3. Disable the ?EnableJMX? property to stop the JMX server.
4. Set ?EnableJMX? to ?true? again.
If you are using Prometheus to monitor Universal Messaging, you must edit the ?pattern? parameter 
for all topic and queue attributes in the jmx_sag_um_exporter.yaml file between steps 3 and 4, as 
follows:
Old version of pattern:
- pattern: com.softwareag.um.server<type=Broker, brokerName=(\S*), destinationType=Queue, 
(.*)><>(TotalPublished)
New version of pattern:
- pattern: com.softwareag.um.server<type=Broker, brokerName=(\S*), destinationType=Queue, 
destinationName=(\S*)><>(TotalPublished)
You must replace (.*) in the old file version with destinationName=(\S*) in the new file version. A 
restart of the server is not required because the changes take effect at run time.

NUM-17766 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix8)

Exempt file, which is used to allow users to bypass authentication when it is mandatory, has been 
updated to support wildcard entries.
The exempt file supports wildcard entries using the * (asterisk) symbol, such as: user@*, *@host. 
However, *@* is not supported, as it will allow any user to bypass authentication, hence making the 
use of authentication worthless. 
Note: Username ?*? is a valid username, but if such user needs to be added into the exempt list, it 
will be read as a wildcard. In such cases we recommend ?*? username to not be used.
Functionality changed:
-authentication exempt users were loaded by default from a ?DSECURITYFILE file. This is now changed 
and the ?DSECURITYFILE is not used anymore to load the exempt users. Exempt users now need to be 
explicitly defined using the -DNirvana.auth.exempt property. 
-when exempt user with invalid password was provided, the expected outcome was authentication 
failure. Now, we do not make difference between exempt user with or without password, so we expect 
successful login in both cases, when user from exempt list tries to login.

NUM-17689 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix8)

Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager shows a negative value for Current Connections in the Totals 
section for a shared or serial durable.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17275 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix8)

Improved the logging for missing JAAS login module

NUM-14367 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix8)

NA

NUM-17735 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix7)

Universal Messaging now offers more verbose logging related to DNS resolution.

NUM-17566 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix7)

The Universal Messaging server might log NullPointerException error messages when JMX is enabled.
When you enable JMX on Universal Messaging, the UM JMX server might register sync queue readers 
incorrectly and log multiple NullPointerException error messages in the nirvana.log. This issue 
occurs when attempting to read events from a queue with a sync consumer.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17552 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix7)

You can create a non-clustered durable on a clustered channel in a Universal Messaging cluster.
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now disregards the nDurableAttributes#isClustered flag. 
When you create a durable object on a clustered channel the durable is clustered even if
the isClustered attribute flag is set to 'false'.

NUM-17289 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix7)

A slave node might fail to join a Universal Messaging cluster, writing a ?fatal file I/O? error to 
the server log.
The node switches back and forth between offline and recovery states until it shuts down. The issue 
occurs when the slave node tries to purge a large number of events on a store.
The issue is resolved. Cluster node recovery times have been improved and slave nodes do not enter a 
recovery loop. This applies directly to any channel or queue that employs multi-file storage.

NUM-17288 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix7)

A very rare condition in slave recovery could leave a slave node with channel(s) not recovered 
resulting in OOM. This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-17044 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix7)

The Universal Messaging realm server now uses the hostname instead of the IP address for 
communication for security purposes.
System requirement: DNS resolution must work properly on the VMs hosting Universal Messaging.

NUM-17440 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

When using Protobuf messages, UM uses the default Protobuf 3 values. This behavior is now 
configurable via a server side configuration option - TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull . Its default value is 
false to retain the current behavior where unset string fields are treated as empty strings and not 
NULL. To change that behavior and treat unset fields as NULL,  set the configuration value of 
TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull to true. 
One can configure TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull via EnterpriseManager->Realm->Config->Show Advanced 
Config->Advanced Configuration->Protobuf Config->TreatUnsetFieldsAsNull.

NUM-17414 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

Restarting Universal Messaging fails with a file I/O error.
The issue might occur when the server tries to load a shared or serial durable with a
selector that has an event buffer size of more than 10 000 symbols. In this case,
Universal Messaging writes the following error in the nirvana.log file:
"Server shutdown initiated due to fatal file I/O error occurred: Unable to load the durable
from, corruption detected...Input exceeded input buffer size."
The issue is resolved. You can now create durables with selectors that have an input event buffer 
size of more than 10 000 symbols.

NUM-17343 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

When the used by customer nodeJS AMQP (Rhea) client was closed- the associated AMQP processing tasks 
were not closed appropriately. This caused high CPU usage caused by UM's server AMQP processing 
threads. Similar high CPU usage was also possible on a idle, non-closed AMQP client connections.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-17334 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

When using NSPS protocol (nsp over SSL) for inter-cluster commmunication, Universal Messaging master 
realm may lockup when writing data to another realm in the cluster if the connection to that realm 
is interrupted. The lockup may prevent the cluster keep alive check to reset the connection and may 
cause the master realm to remain stuck even after the rest of the cluster reforms and elects 
another master.
This issue is now resolved. Universal Messaging server no longer holds any locks when closing an 
inter-realm connection, which enables cluster keep alive handling to close non-responsive 
connections immediately.

NUM-17254 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

Creating a new session to Universal Messaging might fail when working with temporary stores that 
have the autoDelete flag enabled.
Session creation fails with the message "com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nUnexpectedResponseException:

The upper limit for stalled task warning time (StalledTaskWarningTime) used to be 1 minute which is 
insufficient for some customers which have long running tasks. The upper limit is now increased to 
5 minutes in line with older releases. 

NUM-17150 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

After migrating to Universal Messaging version 10.1 or above, a secondary node goes down because the 
connection used for a multiplex session stalls.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17119 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

When clients use the Universal Messaging channel iterator client API to consume events from
a channel with a shared durable, pausing a session to the server might cause messages to be 
perceived as lost.
The issue occurs because the server does not suspend subscriptions properly when a session is 
paused.
In this case, the server might send events to consumers while the consumers are not ready to process 
them.
Such events are perceived as lost, but will be redelivered once the session is closed and a new one 
is established.
This issue is resolved. Now the Universal Messaging server times out all durable subscriptions
when a session is paused, and clients receive a nRequestTimedOutException.

NUM-17062 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix6)

During the cluster destruction process, there could be a communication task executing, that updates 
a server's known state of remote nodes. There was a possibility that those two processes could 
interfere with each other, resulting in a NullPointerException logged in the server log file. This 
issue is now resolved.

NUM-17094 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix5)

A security vulnerability related to the Prometheus JMX functionality was discovered in Universal 
Messaging Docker images.
The issue is resolved. The jmx_prometheus_javaagent binary has been upgraded from version 0.13.0 to

NUM-16534 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix5)

In a Universal Messaging cluster, the JVM crashes with a memory corruption error caused by 
synchronization issues.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16519 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix5)

Universal Messaging servers might crash because of memory issues related to the JMX connections.
After a client unsubscribes from a durable or queue on a realm server, the Universal Messaging 
server might exhaust the available memory and crash.
The issue occurs because Universal Messaging does not properly remove the JMX connections associated 
with the subscription.
The issue is now resolved.
While fixing this particular issue the overall JMX design was improved an optimized, so other issues 
were fixed as well.
This fix is considered an important one for the JMX functionality, so it is strongly recommended for 
customers which use JMX to install it.

NUM-16404 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix5)

After enabling trace logging from Enterprise Manager, the server log shows messages that do not give 
clear details about the traced issue and originate from UM private channels.
The issue is resolved. When trace logging is enabled, Universal Messaging now logs only messages 
from the consumer channels. The log messages now give more information, such as which event details 
are retrieved and from which store. 

NUM-16041 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix5)

NUM-10065 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix5)

When non-durable JMS sync consumer on channel was re-subscribed and there are no new events 
published- it was possible the UM server to not delete the old events kept by the old subscriber.
This is now fixed- when the new consumer is added it will properly reset its interest and the old 
events for which we don't have interest anymore will be deleted.

NUM-16830 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

The Universal Messaging realm server has memory and performance issues when a memory leak occurs in 
the task scheduler.
The issue is resolved. 

NUM-16785 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Creating and then deleting many channels or queues might result in Universal Messaging leaking 
memory and shutting down. 
The issue is now resolved. 

NUM-16533 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Regression in queue filtering could lead to events destined for one queue consumer to be delivered 
to another queue consumer instead. This could potentially lead to stuck consumers and / or disk 
space issues. This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-16472 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Synchronous durable topic or queue consumers that have low timeout values (tenths of milliseconds or 
less) and consume messages from a slave realm in a Universal Messaging cluster might stop consuming 
messages and log the following message in the nirvana.log file for the slave realm:
"Cluster> Rolling back Event IDs to allocate for a local connection that no longer exists."
The issue is resolved. Universal Messaging now has the "TimeoutSynchronousConsumerOnMaster" advanced 
realm configuration property that you can use to switch the timeout procedure to the master realm 
in the cluster. Valid values for the new property are:
true - switches the timeout procedure to the master realm in the cluster
false (default) - the timeout procedure is run on a slave realm in the cluster
Important! You must configure the new property after updating all realms in the cluster to the fix 
version of the master realm.

NUM-16457 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix4)

Despite using a network drive as a data directory, Universal Messaging might store some .mem files

is enabled in Universal Messaging.
When a Universal Messaging server uses the JMX service (with both "EnableJMX" and "EnableLegacyJMX" 
realm configuration properties set to "true"), restarting the UM server instance in Command Central 
fails, because the JMX service continues to run and prevents the server instance from restarting.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-15905 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

The performance of a Universal Messaging cluster might deteriorate when a shared-queued durable 
consumer sends event acknowledgements to a clustered realm.
The problem occurs because the master realm broadcasts event acknowledgements to all nodes in the 
cluster and then waits for the realms to process the acknowledgements.
This issue is now resolved. The Universal Messaging master realm no longer waits for the clustered 
realms to respond to an acknowledgement request.

NUM-15889 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

Creating a channel or queue for a webMethods Cloud Container solution using the Universal Messaging 
Enterprise Manager might result in an error.
When you create a queue or channel for a Cloud Container solution on the JNDI tab in the Universal

NUM-10942 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix2)

A security vulnerability was discovered in Universal Messaging multiplexed sessions.
This issue is now resolved.
The current fix introduces changes in behavior depending on where you install the fix:
- If you install the fix on both the client and the server, creating a session
through nSessionFactory#createMultiplexed will create a multiplexed session only if
no credentials are supplied or the supplied credentials match those of the original session.
In all other cases a normal session is created.
- If you install the fix only on the client, the same behavior as above is observed.
- If you install the fix only on the server, a multiplexed session is created,
but all credentials are ignored. The multiplexed session will use the user of the original session.

This issue is now resolved.

NUM-15865 (NUM_10.7_wM_RealmServer_Fix1)

Beginning with release 10.7, Universal Messaging (UM) servers now have bi-directional compatibility 
with the following Universal Messaging clients:
- native API for Java
- API for JMS
- the Resource Adapter for JMS.
Bi-directional compatibility means that a UM server now works not only with clients that have lower 
version, but also with clients that have higher release version than the server.
We have improved logging and error handling, optimized HTTP-based connection intercepts, and added 
support for Horizontal Scalability (HS) in server environments of mixed release versions. To 
support HS in such environments, we have added a new URL parameter, "HS_PROTOCOL_VERSION".
Parameter description: (Optional) In the "HS_PROTOCOL_VERSION" parameter, you specify the lowest 
release version of the server that the HS session can connect to. This parameter ensures that the 
HS session will use the same protocol version to connect to all servers. The parameter is required 
when the servers in the HS URL have different versions.
Example: The following URL indicates that the HS client will use protocol version 10.5 to connect to 
servers of release version 10.5 or higher. UM1 (nsp://host1:port1) is version 10.5 and UM2 
(nsp://host2:port2) is version 10.7, but because "HS_PROTOCOL_VERSION=10.5", the client session 
will use protocol version 10.5.
(nsp://host1:port1)(nsp://host2:port2)?HS_PROTOCOL_VERSION=10.5
Note that a UM server with release version lower than the version of the client API will not support 
all new functions added in the API. For details about compatibility limitations, see the topics for 
the respective client API in the Universal Messaging documentation.

Caching does not work for multi-file disk stores even when caching is enabled for the server 
instance.
The issue is resolved. By default, caching is not enabled for multi-file stores. To store events 
from a channel with multi-file store in the cache:
1/ When configuring the Universal Messaging server instance, set the EnableStoreCaching and 
EnableCaching server configurations to "true" and restart the server.
2/ When creating a channel with a multi-file store,  "Enable Caching" channel storage properties to 
"true".

8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.
(*) Starting with 10.7 Fix 8, Universal Messaging provides updated versions of security libraries with 
the Universal Messaging realm server fixes, if any of these libraries has been updated. You can find 
the libraries in the UniversalMessaging\lib folder.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation
