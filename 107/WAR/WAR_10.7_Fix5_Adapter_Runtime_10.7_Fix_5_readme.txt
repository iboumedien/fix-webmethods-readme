PIEAR-2310
In webMethods Adapter for Runtime, when the thread destroying JDBC adapter
connections hang, the disabling of adapter packages fails, and Integration Server
does not enter quiesce mode.

This issue is now resolved. Disabling the adapter package and removing JDBC
adapter connections are performed in separate threads. The hanging of the
thread destroying JDBC adapter connections has no impact on the disabling of
adapter packages, and Integration Server enters quiesce mode.


PIEAR-2415
When the health end-point of an adapter is accessed, the listener properties
appear including the runtimeState attribute which is a dictionary of key/value
pairs. If the listener is enabled, then the runtimeState dictionary displays the
runtime state of the listener. If the listener is disabled, then the runtimeState
dictionary displays only currentState as disabled which is the state of the
listener set by the user. 

PIEAR-1760
In webMethods Adapter Runtime, the administrator API GET operations for
notifications do not display the notification type and the notification state.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-2256
Whenever Integration Server is started, a WmAS400 package containing a single
config sub-directory is created.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-2314
In the webMethods Adapter Runtime, an administrator API request to enable a
suspended polling notification fails.

This issue is now resolved. 

PIEAR-2315
In webMethods Adapter Runtime, the administrator API GET operations for
notification do not display the notificationProperties field if the notification
type is a listener. The notificationProperties field is displayed for polling
notifications.

PIEAR-2320
In webMethods Adapter Runtime, the notification state displayed in the
administrator API GET operations are not in sync with the notification status
displayed in the Integration Server Administrator > Server > Scheduler page.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-1949 (WAR_10.7_Fix4)
When CSRF guard is enabled, the user is not able to enable or disable connections
from the Integration Server Administrator screen if opened using chrome or edge
browser.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-1733 (WAR_10.7_Fix4)
When the adapter listeners package is loaded before the adapter package, the
listeners are in Pending Enabled state and fail to change to the Enabled state.

This issue is now resolved.

If the adapter listeners package is loaded before the adapter package, then the
listeners are in the Disabled state and you must enable the listeners manually.
You must ensure proper package dependency is maintained to avoid the error. 

PIEAR-1920 (WAR_10.7_Fix4)
Suspended connection state is not visible in the Integration Server Administrator,
when the CSRF guard is enabled.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-1672 (WAR_10.7_Fix4)
The /health endpoint does not return information about the adapter health
indicator when the Microservices Runtime or a Integration Server instance is
migrated from 10.3 version to 10.7 version.

This issue is now resolved.

Note: The /health endpoint functionality is available in Microservices Runtime
or in an Integration Server instance with a Microservices license.

PIEAR-1733 (WAR_10.7_Fix3)
When the adapter listeners package is loaded before the adapter package, the
listeners are in Pending Enabled state and fail to change to the Enabled state.

This issue is now resolved.

If the adapter listeners package is loaded before the adapter package, then the
listeners are in the Disabled state and you must enable the listeners manually.
You must ensure proper package dependency is maintained to avoid the error.

PIEAR-1899 (WAR_10.7_Fix3)
When the microservices(MSR) are started, the JDBC polling notifications are not
enabled although the property is set to true in the application.properties file.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-1889 (WAR_10.7_Fix3)
The adapter asset properties passed as environment variables arguments in a
docker run command are not substituted for the externalized adapter asset
properties defined in the application.properties file.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-1888 (WAR_10.7_Fix3)
The listeners in webMethods Adapter for Websphere MQ, which are in pending 
enabled state fail to change to enabled state when Integration Server exits the 
quiesce mode.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-1788 (WAR_10.7_Fix3)
The webMethods AdapterRuntime (ART) based adapters configuration properties
which can be configured from Integration Server Administrator are available in
configuration variables template generated by Microservices Runtime.
For more information, see the adapter installation and user guide.

PIEAR-1784 (WAR_10.7_Fix2)
The webMethods AdapterRuntime (ART) asset properties which can be configured
from Integration Server Administrator are available in configuration variables
template generated by Microservices Runtime. Microservices Runtime generates an
application.properties file.

You can update the values of the properties in the application.properties file
and pass to a Microservices Runtime. Microservices Runtime loads the information
from the application.properties and updates the webMethods Adapter Runtime assets
configuration properties.  

PIEAR-1738 (WAR_10.7_Fix2)
In Adapter Runtime, during Integration Server startup, when packages are loading,
an exception occurs in ART node registration, preventing the other nodes in the
package from registering. This occurs when the error resource bundle is not
initialized during node creation.

This issue is now resolved.

PIEAR-1663 (WAR_10.7_Fix2)
When deploying a package using a repository-based deployment, the adapter
runtime fails to re-enable the enabled connections as the passman is not
populated with the password. An error "null password given; logon denied"
is generated.

This issue is now resolved. 

PIEAR-1673 (WAR_10.7_Fix1)
When parallel asset initialization is enabled for an adapter, reloading a package
with listener notification assets is causing a deadlock.
 
This issue is now resolved. 

PIEAR-1582 (WAR_10.7_Fix1)
Listener is launched twice during webMethods Integration Server startup if,
pub.art.listener:enableListener is used in one of the packages as startup
services.

This issue is resolved. 

Enhancements for WMIO

PIEAR-1623 (WAR_10.7_Fix1)

domain calls in a single API for the Database Application in WMIO
