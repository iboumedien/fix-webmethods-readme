same platforms and operating systems and with the same JREs as webMethods

PLS-547

The bundles.info file which lists the active bundles in the OSGi runtime includes a reference to
version 2.13.3 of the third-party library Log4j.

The issue is resolved. While the reference to org.apache.logging.log4j.api_2.13.3.jar
is removed from the bundles.info file, it still appears in <SoftwareAG_directory>/common/runtime/
/bundles/platform/eclipse/plugins. This poses no security risk because the log4j.api_2.13.3.jar file
is no longer listed in the bundles.info file. 



PLS-505

Application Platform contains the third party Log4j 2.11.2, which has known security
vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

The issue is resolved. All Log4j libraries deliviered by the Application Platform product are 
updated to version 2.17.1, which has the vulnerability removed.



PLS-456
The Junit library is upgraded from 4.8.1 to 4.13.1.  The recommended version of the library has 
been upgraded due to a security vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score: 5.5 Medium.  More details may
be found here:  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15250 .

The issue has been corrected.



PLS-431
App Platform product migration to 10.7 from earlier versions of the product was not possible due 
to missing scripts.  

This issue has been corrected.
