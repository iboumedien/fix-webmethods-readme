4.0 Fix Contents 

PLD-124
Improve support for overloaded Java method names in IS service 
generation 

The IS services created to invoke Java methods cannot support 
overloaded method names in Java. Prior to this fix, if an exposed 
Java method has an overloaded name, the generated IS service may 
choose the wrong Java method at invocation time. Also, prior to 
this fix the IS service generation did not properly support an 
@Service annotation that declares multiple interfaces. 

This issue is resolved.
