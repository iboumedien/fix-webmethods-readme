with the following error: "There is no repository to register". The issue occurs when the repository
name contains a space.

The issue is resolved. 

CCE-7067

In the Command Central web user interface, if you have a stack with a layer containing no components
and you execute a lifecycle operation on that layer, Command Central might incorrectly stop all 
components in all environments that it manages.

The issue is resolved. Now it is not possible to execute a lifecycle operation on a layer with no 
components.

CCE-6777  (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 3)
Navigating to the Licensing view in the Command Central web user interface results in a 406 error.
The issue occurs because the following disclaimer fails to display on the Licensing > Reports tab: 
"This License Inventory Management Application (LIMA) provides guidance ..."
The issue is now resolved.

CCE-6561 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 3)
In the Command Central web user interface, after you open the Database catalog for a database layer
in the Stacks view, you cannot view all installed components, because the contents of the database 
catalog do not fit in the screen.

The issue is resolved. Now you can view all installed components when opening the Database catalog.

CCE-6608 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 3)
When upgrading a stack using the Command Central web user interface, if you click the Back button at
the end of step 2 "Specify fixes and parameters for runtime," the upgrade wizard displays a blank
screen and you have to manually scroll back to step 1.

The issue is resolved. Now the upgrade wizard correctly displays step 1 after you click the Back button
in step 2.


CCE-6588 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 2)
In the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface, if there are four or more stacks with
a different number of layers, Command Central does not align the stacks properly on the screen.

The issue is resolved. Command Central now displays up to three stacks per row and aligns them based
on the number of layers they contain.

CCE-6732 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 2)
When you want to create a layer through the Stacks wizard in the Command Central web user interface,
you cannot click the Finish button of the wizard when the screen resolution is higher than 1018p
(Full HD).

The issue is resolved.

CCE-6543 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 2)
The functionality of the following group of commands is updated to create and manage installation
reports (that are not based on license manifest files), instead of license reports based on
license manifest files and installation information:

sagcc create license-tools reports installation
sagcc list license-tools reports installation
sagcc get license-tools reports installation <reportId>
sagcc get license-tools reports installation disclaimer
sagcc delete license-tools reports installation [<reportId>]

Note that the license reports based on license manifest files are deprecated without replacement.

CCE-6548 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 2)
Command Central does not validate the port numbers that you specify when you create,
edit, or upgrade stacks with the upgrade wizard of the web user interface.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central validates the port number values in the 
upgrade wizard.

CCE-6531 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
In the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface, when you click "Upgrade stack"
 for a stack displayed on the right side of the screen, the “Upgrade stack” menu does not 
 fit into the screen.

The issue is resolved. Now the "Upgrade stack" menu is fits into the screen for all stacks.

CCE-6539 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
In the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface, when you click a layer and try to
execute a lifecycle action (for example, start, stop, or pause), Command Central does not start a
job for the lifecycle action and the action is not executed.

The issue is resolved. You can now execute lifecycle actions on layers in the Stacks view.

CCE-6540 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
The following text on the Stacks home page is outdated:"Stacks you create cannot yet be modified,
 updated, or upgraded." You can now modify and upgrade the stacks, but you cannot yet update them.

The issue is resolved. Now the text is corrected to state that you can modify and upgrade the stacks.

CCE-6562 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
When you restart the upgrade of a stack that has an Integration Server run-time layer from 
the Command Central web user interface and use existing templates, the upgrade operation fails 
if the Integration Server instance from the layer is offline. The issue occurs because Command Central
 obtains the required migration properties from the source Integration Server instance, 
 instead of the generated migration templates.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central obtains migration properties from the generated migration
templates when re-starting an upgrade operation for a stack with Integration Server and the operation
does not fail if Integration Server is offline.

CCE-6566 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
When using the Stacks view in the Command Central web user interface, if you expand a layer in a stack, 
click on an instance in the layer,
and click the "Installation alias" link on the instance Overview tab, the installation page does not load.

The issue is resolved. Now the installation page loads successfully after navigating to the instance 
Overview tab from the Stacks view.

CCE-6578 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
Upgrading a stack fails because of failed connection to the database. The issue occurs if at the time 
of creating the database layer in the stack, you specify an encrypted password in the respective field 
in Command Central. Then if you export the migration properties to a file and import them again through 
the Command Central web user interface, the database connection fails during the stack upgrade.

The issue is resolved. You can now successfully migrate a stack after importing a migration properties 
file that contains an encrypted database password.

CCE-6586 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
The Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface is slow to respond when you have nine or more 
existing stacks.

The issue is resolved. Now the stacks load as expected in the Stacks view, even when you have over 
nine existing stacks.

CCE-6587 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 WebUI Fix 1)
During a stack upgrade with the upgrade wizard in Command Central, the "Specify fixes and parameters" 
section might fail to load the migration properties and displays an error. The issue occurs when run-time
components from the layers in the stack are offline when you open the upgrade wizard.

The issue is resolved.
