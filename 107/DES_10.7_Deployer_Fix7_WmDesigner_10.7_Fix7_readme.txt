1.0 Fix Name

WmDesigner 10.7 Fix 7 for Deployer



2.0 Fix ID

DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix7



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects Designer Process Development for Deployer (WmDesigner package).



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies


For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section of the Software AG Empower Product 
Support website at https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp



5.0 Platform Support

This fix is supported on the same platforms as webMethods Designer Process Development 
Deployer 10.7 (WmDesigner package).



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

This fix needs to be installed on all servers hosting the WmDesigner package, including 
the Deployer source and target servers.



7.0 Fix Contents

WMDPD-10298
In webMethods Process Development, when you install WmDesigner_10.7_Fix6 and start Integration Server, 
an error message appears in the server log: "Missing class wm.designer.sim.fitDistribution."

The issue is resolved.

WMDPD-10277(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix6)
The following Process Simulation JAR files are now removed from the WmDesigner package:
- Simprocess.jar
- SPInterface.jar
- SPRemote.jar
- Modelfit.jar
- jh.jar

The issue is resolved.
 
WMDPD-10244(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix5)
"In webMethods Deployer, when you roll back an initial deployment to the target server, 
the process models remain enabled for execution.

The issue is resolved. The process models are now disabled after the roll back.

Important - If the project defines deployment sets that include Integration Server assets, 
they are removed from the target server after the roll back. This can lead to issues if any 
process instances exist for the given process models."

WMDPD-10061(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix4)
Process Audit connection may not be returned to the pool after deployment

After deploying process models from a repository based project with webMethods Deployer 
the active database connection may not be returned to the JDBC pool. 
This causes the pooled connection to remain active and the physical connection to remain open.

The issue is resolved.

WMDPD-10151(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix4)
In Process Deployer build of BPM deployment set will fail when the set contains task assets.

This issue is resolved.

WMDPD-10200(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix4)
With webMethods Process Development, checkpoint generation fails during asset deployment 
if the Integration Server host uses a PostgreSQL database.

The issue is now resolved.

WPE-4862(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix3)
With webMethods Process Engine, support is added for model deployment
during package loading.

A new setting 'Upload Model' is added to the WmPRT homepage. Enabling this
setting instructs Process Engine to upload the metadata for a process model if
the model artifacts are present in the package built in Process Designer. 
The uploaded metadata can be used in a containerized environment, for example, Docker.

Designer Process Development
To support the upload of metadata from an Integration Server running under Docker, 
during the build and upload of the BPM project, the process "collects" process files, 
configuration files, and image data from the process editor canvas. When the process 
model is saved, the JPEG and SVG image files are generated from the canvas and stored 
in the workspace. During build and upload, the image files are taken from the workspace 
and written to the generated BPM package together with the process files and configuration files. 
This feature is available for process models that were built after applying the fix 
DES_10.7_Process_Fix2.

Metadata Deployment and Process Activation
During start up/loading of the WmPRT package, the package scans the BPM packages looking 
for the process fragments and Process Engine passes the name of the BPM package. 
Afterwards Process Engine reads the models directory and uploads the process models 
contained there. After the metadata is uploaded, the QoS settings are updated and the 
process is enabled for execution. Process Engine uploads the metadata if no metadata 
exists for the given process key and model version, or if the last modification date of 
the process file is greater than the deployment timestamp. The timestamp check can handle 
the case where the model has been changed without changing the model version. As a best practice, 
always increment the model version when building/deploying an updated process model. 
This feature works in conjunction with services in the WmDesigner package, 
so please ensure to apply the fix DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix3.

WMDPD-10095(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix2)
When writing data to PostgreSQL DB, Deployer fails with the following error:
Error writing data to the database: com.wm.app.b2b.server.ServiceException: java.sql.SQLDataException:
[SoftwareAG][PostgreSQL JDBC Driver]The hexadecimal string is invalid

The issue is resolved.

WMDPD-10079(DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix1)
Software AG Designer Process Development uses an outdated version of the
third party component Xbean, which has known security vulnerabilities.

The issue is resolved. The Xbean jar is migrated to the stable version 3.1.0.
