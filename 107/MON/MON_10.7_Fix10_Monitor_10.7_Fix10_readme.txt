1.0 Fix Name

webMethods Monitor 10.7 Fix 10 (WmMonitor package update)



2.0 Fix ID

MON_10.7_Fix10



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects webMethods Monitor 10.7.



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

Optimize 10.7 Fix 12 or higher is required. Optimize fixes contain updates to shared components,
used by both Monitor and Optimize products, so Optimize optimizeSharedLib 10.7 Fix 12 should be installed even if
Optimize is not present on the machine.

It is also recommended to update to the latest fix level for related BPM products
such as Designer, Process Engine, Optimize and ESB, and Business Console.

For language pack requirements, see the Globalization section of the Software AG Empower Product
Support website at https://empower.softwareag.com/Products/Globalization/default.asp



5.0 Platform Support

This fix is supported on all platforms supported by webMethods Monitor.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. For RGHWPE-4389 PostgreSQL database support for Monitor.
Set Default archiving parameter in the OPERATION_PARAMETER table:
        PostgreSQL: Process Audit Log schema name

2. BPM Archival for PostgreSQL database only supports multiple schemas with single db only.
For E.g:

CREATE DATABASE bpmarchive(db name);
 \c bpmarchive;(connect to database)

CREATE SCHEMA processbpm(process schema name);
SET search_path TO processbpm;

-- create user now --
CREATE USER processbpmuser (process schema user);
ALTER USER processbpmuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'manage';
ALTER USER processbpmuser SET search_path = processbpm;

--grant permissions --
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE bpmarchive TO processbpmuser;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA processbpm TO processbpmuser;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA processbpm TO processbpmuser;
--below grants are needed to make sure if user creates new objects in future , grants are
available for them too
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON FUNCTIONS TO processbpmuser;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA processbpm GRANT ALL ON TYPES TO processbpmuser;

--create archive schema now --
CREATE SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm(archive schema name);
SET search_path TO archiveprocessbpm;

-- create user now --
CREATE USER archiveprocessbpmuser(archive schema user) ;
ALTER USER archiveprocessbpmuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'manage';
ALTER USER archiveprocessbpmuser SET search_path = archiveprocessbpm;

--grant permissions --
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE bpmarchive TO archiveprocessbpmuser;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA archiveprocessbpm TO archiveprocessbpmuser;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA processbpm TO archiveprocessbpmuser;

7.0 Fix Contents

WMN-8362
In webMethods Monitor, several API queries consume a lot of memory.

The issue is resolved. The following services are modified so that the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter in monitor.cnf applies to them.

pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceList
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListWithFilter
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomDataSet
pub.monitor.process.instance:getInstanceListCustomData
pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList

If you set useExactMatch to True, your search query will return only those INSTANCEID,
PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID results which exactly match your search term. An isExactMatch input parameter is also added to these services. isExactMatch works like the useExactMatch parameter, but takes priority over it.

New parameter reference:
  isExactMatch
  
  This parameter allows you to control whether your search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  
Valid values are:
  false - Default value for isExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID.
  true - If you set isExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  conditions for INSTANCEID, PARENTINSTANCEID, and CUSTOMID. The query will return only those
  results which exactly match your search term.


WMN-8200 (MON_10.7_Fix9)
In webMethods Monitor, when the node name is changed from lower case to upper case, a new wm.monitor.admin:imageCleanup task is scheduled after each Integration Server restart.

In webMethods Monitor, when you open the Process Step Detail page, the Step Errors window displays an exception.

The issue is resolved.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-8143 (MON_10.7_Fix6)

WMN-7958 (MON_10.7_Fix5)
In webMethods Monitor, when you terminate an Oracle Database archive service and start a new service, a message for 
a successful operation appears, but no data is archived.

The issue is resolved. To archive data, grant SELECT privilege to the Archive User:
1. Install the MON_10.7_Database_Fix3 fix.
2. Open Oracle Database and log in as a SYS user.
3. Execute the "GRANT SELECT ON V_$SESSION TO <archive_user>;" SQL procedure, where <archive_user> is the user used to 
log in to the Archive database.

WMN-8058 (MON_10.7_Fix5)
In webMethods Monitor, after you restart Integration Server, the Scheduler page displays a number of scheduled tasks with 
the imageCleanup service.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7953 (MON_10.7_Fix4)
With webMethods Monitor, search query performance needs to be improved.

The issue is resolved. To improve search query performance on an SQL Server database configured in Integration Server,
the wm.monitor.useExactMatch parameter is added to the monitor.cnf configuration file.

New parameter reference:
  useExactMatch

  This parameter allows you to control whether a search by keyword query performed from the
  Process Instance Detail page will use the UPPER and LIKE functions for instanceID and
  parentinstanceID.

Valid values are:
  false - Default value for useExactMatch. The search query will use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID.
  true - If you set useExactMatch to True, the search query will not use the UPPER and LIKE
  functions for instanceID and parentinstanceID. The search query will return only those results
  which exactly match your search term.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7997 (MON_10.7_Fix4)
With webMethods Monitor, when you open a process details page in Business Console, the Summary tab does not display process

passed to the service. Security tools may report these failures as a possible SQL injection vulnerability.

The issue is resolved.

WMN-7668(MON_10.7_Fix2)
With WebMethod Monitor, performance of the pub.monitor.process.instance:getPagedInstanceList
service needs to be improved.

The issue is resolved. A new parameter, isExactMatch, is added to improve the service performance.

New parameter reference:
isExactMatch
This parameter is used to specify whether the query uses UPPER and LIKE function for instance ID.
Valid values are:
- true - the query will not use UPPER and LIKE function for instanceID.
Complete instanceID needs to be provided for the query to function properly.
- false (default) - the query uses UPPER and LIKE function for instanceID.

WMN-7679(MON_10.7_Fix2)
With webMethods Monitor, the pipeline might not be visualized properly.

Pipeline documents that contain tables or two dimensional arrays fail to render properly in the Edit Pipeline view. When this issue occurs an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException can be found in the server log.

This issue is resolved.
