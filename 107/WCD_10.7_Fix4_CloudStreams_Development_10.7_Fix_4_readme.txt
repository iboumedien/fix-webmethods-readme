7.0 Fix Contents

WCD-2048 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

While editing of cloud connector service, custom parameters from simple record 
type fields are missing.

This issue is now resolved.

WCD-2059 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

Headers/mappings for multi-authentication enabled connectors were not updating 
correctly when the connection alias was changed from the pool.

This issue is now resolved.

WCD-2004 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

If there are no webMethods.io Integration tenants configured and 
a user tries to unpublish a connector from Development/Target Server(s), 
the "Next" button on the "List of Target(s)" page does not work.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-1984 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

While publishing connectors to webmethods.io Integration tenants, 
if the first connector is not selected from the list of connectors 
of the same provider, the metadata for connectors was incorrectly set.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-1985 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

The "Select All" button is enabled in the "Unpublish provider" screen 
even in scenarios where there are no published connectors to select.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-2004 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

If there are no webMethods.io Integration tenants configured and a user 
tries to unpublish a connector from Development/Target Server(s), the 
"Next" button on the "List of Target(s)" page does not work.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-2011 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

Users can create operations dynamically by pointing to a WSDL hosting web 
URL or by uploading a Workday WSDL file locally. For complex operations, 
the "Next" button should be enabled to select an abstract object on the 
"Operation and Business Object Configuration" wizard.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-1967 (WCD_10.7_Fix4)

Following Readme document outlines two issues related to importing projects in Eclipse: 

The "Import Provider Archive" function throws an error message that fails to accurately 
describe what went wrong. The issue is caused by an incorrect structure inside the ZIP 
file, resulting in the failure of the project import. The displayed error message is 
not helpful because the corresponding exception was not handled correctly in the code. 
To resolve this issue, modifications were made to the code and incorporated, and the 
error message string was subsequently revised and reviewed. 

The "Import Provider Project" function does not work when a project is selected. 
The "Finish" button remains grayed out. This issue occurs when attempting to import 
a folder that is not an existing "Workspace" project. The Designer in Eclipse will 
not detect the folder as a Provider project file because the .project file is missing. 
As a result, no project folder is detected for the specified file location, and the 
"Finish" button remains grayed out. The resolution is to only import project files 
that are part of the Workspace. 

WF-16743 (WCD_10.7_Fix3)

Support for Publish and Unpublish of Connectors

Publish connectors to a webMethods.io Integration tenant

CloudStreams provides you the ability to publish connectors that reside within 
the on-premises application to the desired webMethods.io Integration tenant.

Unpublish published connectors from a webMethods.io Integration tenant

CloudStreams provides you the ability to unpublish the published connectors 
from the webMethods.io Integration tenant.


WCD-1890 (WCD_10.7_Fix2)
Global mappings with source and target as IDATA are not supported.

CloudStreams now supports adding mappings with both source and target
as IDATA. We have updated the implementations to handle this scenario.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5583 (WCD_10.7_Fix2)
The look up details provided in the REST connector descriptor for 
any resource are not added to the node-hints of the cloud connector service.

The resource metadata was not passed to the implementation where the 
node-hints created for cloud connector service. Updated implementation 
to provide metadata while creating node-hints.

This issue is resolved.


WST-5609 (WCD_10.7_Fix2)
Few back-ends expect percent-encoding of reserved characters in the URI.

When a URI-based parameter value, containing a reserved character, has a special
meaning (a "reserved purpose") and the URI scheme has a different meaning or purpose
of the reserved character, then the reserved character must be percent-encoded. An
error occurs if an URI with a reserved character is not handled properly.

This issue is resolved.


WCD-1865 (WCD_10.7_Fix1)

The error messages that appear in the WSDL validation panel in 
designer is not localized. This panel appears in cases where 
CloudStreams fails to resolve the WSDL location and thus cannot 
access the WSDL.

In webMethods CloudStreams, the screen for validating the workday 
WSDL is not localized.

This issue is resolved.

WCD-1886 (WCD_10.7_Fix1)

The status and statusMessage fields do not appear in the output signature of the
cloud connector service for SOAP and for the REST that uses a custom handler connector.

This issue is now resolved.


8.0 Installation

Step 1: Install using the Software AG Update Manager. For instructions, 
see the documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: If you have migrated your connector services from a version prior to 
CloudStreams 9.7 and impacted by WST-2213, and you are yet to run the migration
utility as suggested in WST-2213, go to Step 2, else skip Step 2. If you have
created your connector services with a CloudStreams 9.7 or later version, you do
not need to run the migration utility.

Step 2: Run the CloudStreams migration utility (pub.cloudstreams.migration:migrate)
to migrate your old CloudStreams artifacts to the latest version.
For more information on the migration utility, see the Integration Server upgrade 
section in the "Upgrading Software AG Products" guide.



9.0 Uninstallation

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager. For instructions see the 
documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently 
installed fix. This action will revert your installation to the previously 
installed fix. You cannot apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data.


10.1 Localization

This fix does not require an updated Language Pack. It might contain new messages
and these messages will appear in English.
