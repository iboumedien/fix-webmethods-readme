The issue is resolved. The fix deprovision job now runs successfully. 


CCE-7734 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 9)

When using Software AG Command Central Side-by-Side migration to upgrade a stack from version 
10.3 to version 10.7, the upgrade fails with an error.

CCE-7169 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 7)

After the bootstrapping of a Platform Manager installation on a remote host fails, 
you cannot view the logs for the bootstrap job in the Jobs view in Command Central.

The issue is resolved.

CCE-7093 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 7)

When you try to get a nonexistent installation report by name in the Command Central CLI,
you get a 500 Internal Server Error instead of 404 Not Found.

The issue is resolved.

CCE-7018 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 7)

When using stacks to do an overinstall migration, the migration might fail when the 
stack name and the alias of the Platform Manager node are long.

The issue is resolved.

SPM-5356 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 7)

Installing fixes with Software AG Command Central might fail with an error.

When installing fixes over an HTTPS connection, Command Central fails to connect to 
Platform Manager. The issue occurs because of a defect in the JDK that Command Central uses.

The issue is resolved. The workaround described in the JDK-8160347 issue is now 
implemented in Command Central.

SPM-5299 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 6)

In Command Central, when migrating a Platform Manager installation, which has a password containing
special characters, the migration fails with an error.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central successfully migrates Platform Manager installations,
which have passwords containing special characters.

CCE-6845 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 4)
The dynamic configuration of Git repositories added in Command Central exposes clear text passwords.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central encrypts all passwords when adding a Git repository.
However, if you have added Git repositories in Command Central before installing this fix, you must
complete the following steps for each repository to make sure no clear text passwords are exposed:
1. Navigate to <Software AG_directory>\profiles\CCE\configuration\
com.softwareag.platform.config.propsloader and open the
"com.softwareag.repository.git.pid-<repository_name>.properties" file in a text editor.
2. Add "@secure." in front of each property name that has a password value. For example:
@secure.password=mypassword
3. Save the file.


SUM-4681/CCE-6927 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 3)
With Software AG Command Central applying template with fixes might fail.
The problem is related with validation of fix repository.

The issue is resolved.

CCE-6546 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 3)
Running the "sagcc create stacks layers" CLI command (with layerType=DATABASE)
adds a database layer to an installation that does not have the Database Component 
Configurator installed.
The issue is resolved. Now if an installation listed in the "nodes" argument of the 
"sagcc create stacks layers" command does not have the Database Component Configurator installed,
 the command fails with an error and Command Central does not add a database layer.


CCE-6714 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 2)
In the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface, if there is a registered 
stack with a Platform Manager instance that is offline, Command Central reports the 
following exception: "Product SPM does not support instance management".

The issue is resolved. Command Central does not throw exceptions if a stack contains an
offline Platform Manager instance.

CCE-6821 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 2)
The Command Central Web UI might return a timeout error when attempting to list fixes 
on a landscape node.
The issue is now resolved.

CCE-6543 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 2)
The functionality of the following group of commands is updated to create and manage installation
reports (that are not based on license manifest files), instead of license reports based on
license manifest files and installation information:

sagcc create license-tools reports installation
sagcc list license-tools reports installation
sagcc get license-tools reports installation <reportId>
sagcc get license-tools reports installation disclaimer
sagcc delete license-tools reports installation [<reportId>]

Note that the license reports based on license manifest files are deprecated without replacement.

CCE-6768 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 2)
The Command Central CLI might hang when attempting to list a configuration instance 
that does not exist in the landscape using the "sagcc list configuration instances" 
command. The issue occurs when Command Central manages a large number of installations.

The issue is resolved. Now the CLI does not hang and returns the following message: 
"No objects found".


CCE-6584 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
When upgrading a stack with version 10.1 using the Command Central web user interface
or the CLI, Command Central may incorrectly generate an infrastructure layer template
containing products that are not part of the new Platform Manager instance.

The issue is resolved. Command Central now generates a correct infrastructure template
containing only the products that are part of the Platform Manager instance.

CCE-6593 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
After upgrading a stack using the Command Central web user interface, some of the required product
licenses are not applied and displayed for the respective product. The issue occurs because Command
Central fails to include all product licenses in the generated migration templates.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central includes all product licenses in the generated migration
templates.

CCE-6759 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
In Command Central, if you set the
"com.softwareag.platform.management.client.template.composite.skip.remote.source.archive.check"
property to "true" and execute disconnected migration with composite templates to a target node that
does not have SSH enabled, the migration incorrectly fails due to missing SSH connectivity.

The issue is resolved. Now you can successfully execute disconnected migration to a target with no
SSH enabled when setting the property to "true".

CCE-6528 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
The order of created stacks in Command Central might be incorrect.

The issue is resolved.

CCE-6545 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
Installing Platform Manager on remote Windows hosts using the “sag-spm-boot-winrm” default template 
fails with the following error message:
'[CCECPTE0078] Composite template validation for sag-spm-boot-winrm completed: VALIDATION FAILED 
[EXPLANATION] The validation has detected that the composite template cannot be applied successfully. 
[ACTION] Read the validation report, fix the errors, and try again.'

The issue is resolved. Now you can successfully install Platform Manager on a remote windows host
using the "sag-spm-boot-winrm" template.

SUM-4616 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
When upgrading a stack containing more than eight run-time components using the Command Central web user interface
or the CLI, the upgrade might fail during the validation of the generated templates.

The issue is resolved.

CCE-6585 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
The Upgrade stack menu in the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface remains active for stacks, 
whose upgrade is in progress. However, if you use the menu and start another upgrade operation while 
the current one is in progress, the stack upgrade job will fail.

CCE-6527 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
If an asset repository that is registered in Command Central gets corrupted (for example, after the repository 
location was updated manually in the file system), Command Central stops listing any asset repositories in the 
web user interface. As a result, you cannot remove the corrupted repository through the web user interface.

The issue is resolved. Now if an asset repository gets corrupted, Command Central lists all asset repositories. 
You can review the Command Central and Platform Manager logs to locate any corrupted asset repositories and 
remove the corrupted repositories.

CCE-6532 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
The logs for a dry-run or full upgrade with a stack do not include sufficient details to troubleshoot errors 
during the stack upgrade or the validation of the generated migration templates. Command Central validates each
 of the generated migration templates but does not include the names of the validated templates in the logs, 
 so that you can trace the reported errors to the template, in which they occurred.

The issue is resolved. Now the validation log entries for the update stack operation include the names of 
the validated templates.

CCE-6537 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
When upgrading with an existing stack, if a run-time layer depends on a database layer, the upgrade
might fail when the run-time component attempts to connect to the database during the upgrade
operation. The issue occurs because when you add a database layer to an existing stack, Command
Central adds the database layer as the top layer in the stack. However, when upgrading the stack,
Command Central always upgrades the layers from bottom to top (lowest to highest index number) and
the database layer is migrated last.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central adds the database layer of a stack below the first
run-time layer.

CCE-6539 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
In the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface, when you click a layer and try to
execute a lifecycle action (for example, start, stop, or pause), Command Central does not start a
job for the lifecycle action and the action is not executed.

The issue is resolved. You can now execute lifecycle actions on layers in the Stacks view.

CCE-6562 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
When you restart the upgrade of a stack that has an Integration Server run-time layer from the 
Command Central web user interface and use existing templates, the upgrade operation fails if 
the Integration Server instance from the layer is offline. The issue occurs because Command Central 
obtains the required migration properties from the source Integration Server instance, 
instead of the generated migration templates.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central obtains migration properties from the generated migration 
templates when re-starting an upgrade operation for a stack with Integration Server and the operation
does not fail if Integration Server is offline.

CCE-6595 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
In some cases when executing a migration of type overinstall using a template or the Stacks view of 
the Command Central web user interface,
Command Central attempts to rename the source installation directory before all run-time components are stopped.
As a result, the migration fails.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central waits for all run-time components to report status 
"Stopped" before renaming the source installation directory.

CCE-6558 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
When adding a layer to an existing stack using the Command Central web user interface, the Add layer 
drop-down box loads slower than expected when the Platform Managers in the infrastructure layers of 
several stacks are offline.

The issue is resolved. Now the now Add layer drop-down box loads normally even when several Platform 
Managers are offline.

CCE-6559 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
The layers in existing stacks load slowly in the Stacks view of the Command Central web user interface 
when the Platform Managers in the infrastructure layers of multiple stacks are offline.

The issue is resolved. Now the layers load normally in the Stacks view even when multiple Platform Managers
are offline.

CCE-6587 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
During a stack upgrade with the upgrade wizard in Command Central, the "Specify fixes and parameters" section
might fail to load the migration properties and displays an error. The issue occurs when run-time components 
from the layers in the stack are offline when you open the upgrade wizard.

The issue is resolved.

CCE-6596 (Software AG Command Central 10.7 Fix 1)
When upgrading a stack that contains a database layer, if the database URL contains special
characters, the database migration fails. The issue occurs because Command Central does not enclose
in quotation marks the value of the "db.url" parameter in the generated migration template and the
database URL is not parsed correctly.

The issue is resolved. Now Command Central encloses the "db.url" value in quotation marks.
