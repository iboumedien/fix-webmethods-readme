7.0 Fix Contents

WPE-5151
The inline subprocess instances that are interrupted when the parent instance reaches terminal status, are not cleaned by Storage Cleaner.

The issue is now resolved.

WPE-4491 (PRT_10.7_Fix2)
With webMethods Process engine, logged field is incorrectly truncated.

Logged field values of type String were truncated to 512 bytes instead of 1024 bytes which the database allowed.

This issue is now resolved. Process engine now supports logging of upto 2000 bytes. 

WPE-4993 (PRT_10.7_Fix2)
With webMethods Process Engine, when you execute the pub.prt.admin:suspendProcesses and pub.prt.admin:resumeProcesses services for process models with multiple versions, a "Cannot close latch" error message might appear in the server log.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4811(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, the Process tracker may not process control operations correctly.

The Process tracker may not process control operations correctly when communicating with Optimize and the process ID is missing.

The issue resolved. Process Engine now communicates with an updated Optimize MAPI interface.

WPE-4819(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, process instances containing a Join Timeout transition 
type might fail to transit to the next step once the timeout expires. 

The issue is resolved. 

WPE-4831(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
Storage cleaner procedure with latest PostgreSQL 13 caused this error "operator does not exist: smallint = text", as storage procedure was not found.

This issue has now been resolved.

WPE-4858(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, custom ID may not be present
in the EDA events.

In long running processes, if Integration Server is restarted in between, the process EDA events may contain no Custom ID though it was set correctly.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4864(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, an exception may be logged 
during startup.

[BPM.0101.0002E] (tid=1726) Exception: com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nSecurityException

The issue is resolved. This fix requires IS_10.7_Core_Fix1

WPE-4909(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, a deadlock may occur under load.

A deadlock may occur with webMethods Process Engine when one of the
threads is executing handleRestartCommand while another thread is
executing the changeProcessStatus service.

This issue is resolved.

WPE-4788(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, a process instance may fail to execute normally.

A process instance may stop abruptly if the Task Engine notification failed for any reason.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4792(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, Process wide error handler step may execute twice.

A process instance that transitions to process wide error handler step is executed twice after a join timeout occurs at an intermediate message event step.

The issue is resolved.

WPE-4862(PRT_10.7_Fix1)
With webMethods Process Engine, support is added for model deployment
during package loading.

A new setting 'Upload Model' is added to the WmPRT homepage. Enabling this
setting instructs Process Engine to upload the metadata for a process model if
the model artifacts are present in the package built in Process Designer. The uploaded metadata can be used in a containerized environment, for example, Docker.

Designer Process Development
To support the upload of metadata from an Integration Server running under Docker, during the build and upload of the BPM project, the process "collects" process files, configuration files, and image data from the process editor canvas. When the process model is saved, the JPEG and SVG image files are generated from the canvas and stored in the workspace. During build and upload, the image files are taken from the workspace and written to the generated BPM package together with the process files and configuration files. This feature is available for process models that were built after applying the fix DES_10.7_Process_Fix2.

Metadata Deployment and Process Activation 
During start up/loading of the WmPRT package, the package scans the BPM packages looking for the process fragments and Process Engine passes the name of the BPM package. Afterwards Process Engine reads the models directory and  uploads the process models contained there. After the metadata is uploaded, the QoS settings are updated and the process is enabled for execution. Process Engine uploads the metadata if no metadata exists for the given process key and model version, or if the last modification date of the process file is greater than the deployment timestamp. The timestamp check can handle the case where the model has been changed without changing the model version. As a best practice, always increment the model version when building/deploying an updated process model. This feature works in conjunction with services in the WmDesigner package, so please ensure to apply the fix DES_10.7_Deployer_Fix3.


8.0 Installation

10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods product suite and includes 
support for operation in any country, locale, or language as specified in the Installing webMethods 
Products guide. It was not tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this 
fix has no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported locale or 
configuration.
