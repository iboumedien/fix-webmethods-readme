NUM-20446 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix19)

In some of the cases (lack of permissions in ACL, cluster not formed...), creating a JNDI context 
fails and Enterprise Manager does not show anythink as error information.
Now we show a little UI dialog that informs customer what is the problem. The explanation of error 
message comes from exception cause this failure.

NUM-16156 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix19)

Universal Messaging does not provide an option to export Protobuf
definitions from a channel or queue.
The Protobuf definitions are needed when you want to explore
the structure of a payload in a client application or when you
import or export the contents of a channel or queue.
The issue is resolved. Now you can export Protobuf definitions
from a channel or queue in the following ways:
- Using a new command-line tool named ExportProtobufDefinitions.
- Using the Enterprise Manager. A new option, Export Protobuf Definitions,
has been added to the context menu for a channel or queue.
In addition, the ExportRealmXML and ImportRealmXML command-line tools
also have options for exporting and importing Protobuf definitions, respectively.

NUM-19822 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix15)

Before the fix, user is unable to create/Delete the site in Enterprise Manager -> Cluster -> Sites 
tab. Site tab did not display the Site details if the sites are already present.
After this fix, User will be able to create/delete the Site from Enterprise Manager. The Site 
details will also be displayed in Enterprise Manager Site panel if the site details are present

NUM-19468 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix14)

Adding a consumer to a UM Store leaves the sub-name field in the Connections tab empty.
Issue is resolved.

NUM-19430 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix14)

Universal Messaging now supports defining the number of concurrent connections per user.
You can use a new realm configuration property, "MaxNoOfConnectionsPerUserName", part of the 
"Connection Config" group in the Enterprise Manager, to specify the number of concurrent 
connections per user. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of connections. 
Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647. When you set a limit, if connections exceed the 
specified number, the client will get an nSecurityException. However, admin connections with the 
"Realm Override Connection Count" permission are still allowed to connect to the realm server.
In addition, the existing "MaxNoOfConnections" property, controls the total number of concurrent 
connections to the server. When you set a limit on the total number, connections that exceed the 
limit are rejected if they are non-admin connections or if they do not have the "Realm Override 
Connection Count" permission. The default is -1, which means no limit is set on the number of 
connections. Valid values range between -1 and 2147483647.

NUM-19291 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix14)

Creation of an interface when there is an existing interface with the same port was allowed.
This issue is resolved.

NUM-19126 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix14)

The Universal Messaging TraceStores realm configuration property in Enterprise Manager is not 
updated correctly.
You cannot remove the names of all the stores specified in the TraceStores configuration property. 
At least one store that you cannot delete remains specified.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-16276 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix14)

Deleting durables might cause extra memory usage in Enterprise Manager over time.
The issue occurs because the nDurablePanel and nDurableSnoopPanel objects for the deleted durables 
continue to exist in memory.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18812 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix12)

An additional console opens when you start Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-18456 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix11)

When you export a realm configuration in an xml file using Enterprise Manager, Universal Messaging 
wrongly appends "@" at the end of a join destination.
The issue occurs when the source channel in a join has a namespace.
This issue is now resolved. 

NUM-18351 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix11)

The WarningThreshold realm configuration parameter is missing from Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved. The WarningThreshold has been added back to Enterprise Manager. You can 
configure the parameter as part of the Basic Configuration category on the Config tab.

NUM-18198 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix10)

The Top Channel Usage tab in Enterprise Manager does not display the rate of consumed and published 
events.
Instead, the tab displays only the total number of consumed and published events.
The issue is resolved. The tab now displays both the rate and total number of consumed and published 
events.

NUM-17698 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix7)

Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager might not update the Filter field for a durable.
When you edit the filter for a durable, Enterprise Manager might not display the updated value in 
the Filter field in the Durables table. The correct value is displayed only after you restart 
Enterprise Manager.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-17502 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix7)

Protobuf descriptor missing after channel edit
When editing the storage properties of a store, the protobuf properties might get lost in the 
process.
The issue is resolved

NUM-17380 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix6)

Fix Enterprise Manager (EM) to copy Protobuf settings when editing a channel or queue. If user edits 
a channel or queue via EM, the Protobuf settings will be lost. This issue is now resolved.

NUM-12620 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix4)

Replaced @XmlAttribute with @XmlTransient on "queued" and "priorityEnabled"

NUM-16219 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix3)

Top tab has been updated to display more channel details

NUM-15236 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix2)

The Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fails to perform some operations
because it uses non-admin connections to the Universal Messaging server for those operations.
When the Universal Messaging server is configured to not allow non-admin client connections,
the Enterprise Manager fails to perform the operations that use non-admin connections to the server.
For example, the problem happens after you set the ClusterMode parameter to 'Replication', which
means Universal Messaging does not allow non-admin connections to cluster nodes other than the 
master node.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-13424 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix2)

Enterprise Manager does not connect to nsps port.
This issue has been resolved.

NUM-15315 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

The Enterprise Manager for Universal Messaging might stop responding when you click a queue to view 
its status.
Such a situation might also happen when you try to view the status of a channel or a durable in the 
Enterprise Manager.
The issue is now resolved.

NUM-15163 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

Universal Messaging writes messages to already rolled nirvana.log files.
The problem occurs because Universal Messaging does not use the correct logging framework. The 
server uses the default logging framework instead of the additionally specified Log4J2 framework.
The issue is resolved. Now all packages use the correct logger for the package level.

NUM-14901 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

Exporting or importing a realm configuration into XML results in missing or incomplete joins 
details.
When exporting or importing realm configurations from Enterprise Manager or using the "nexportrealm" 
or "nimportrealm" code samples, one of the following issues occurs:
- The exported XML file does not include any information about the remote joins.
- The joins entries in the exported XML file do not include the details of the remote realm, which 
incorrectly represents the join as local.
- The information about the remote joins does not get imported.
The issues are now resolved.

NUM-13647 (NUM_10.7_wM_EnterpriseManager_Fix1)

Importing the interfaces are based on ports uniqueness based. nsp and nsps imports work when the 
aliases are similar. It creates new aliases with new ports and work. But due to some reason, the 
nhp and nhps didn't work when the aliases are similar. But they work when the aliases are 
different. 
When an interface with the same host and port is present, a new interface gets added and then the 
status is changes to Error. 
These issues are solved.


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.
(*) Starting with 10.7 Fix 8, Universal Messaging provides updated versions of security libraries with 
the Universal Messaging realm server fixes, if any of these libraries has been updated. You can find 
the libraries in the UniversalMessaging\lib folder.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix,
