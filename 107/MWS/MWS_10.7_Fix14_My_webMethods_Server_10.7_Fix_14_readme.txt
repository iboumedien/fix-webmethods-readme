6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1.If MWS_10.7_Fix14 is the first My webMethods Server fix installed using Software AG 
   Update Manager then the fix cannot be uninstalled using Software AG Update Manager.
   To uninstall the fix later, stop My webMethods Server and back up the My webMethods Server 
   database and file system before installing the fix.
   Please see section 9.0 Un-Installation.    

2. Before starting a fix installation shut down all My webMethods Server cluster nodes. 
   Software AG Update Manager will shut down and restart My webMethods Server during fix 
   installation. Software AG Update Manager waits for a preconfigured time of 300000 ms (5 mins) 
   for My webMethods Server to shut down and restart. If a particular My webMethods Server 
   instance takes more time for shutdown and restart, you can configure the wait time by setting
   the following system property for Software AG Update Manager:
   -Dmws.shutdown.waittime = <time_in_ms>
   
3. If multiple nodes exist in one SAG installation directory, the Software AG Update Manager will 
   install the fix on all the nodes.
   
4. If the cluster nodes are on different installation/machines, the fix installation should be done 
   sequentially for each My webMethods Server cluster node. Wait for Software AG Update Manager to 
   complete the fix installation on one My webMethods Server installation before installing the fix to 
   another cluster node installation/machine.

5. If you have a webMethods product that runs outside of the current webMethods installation 
   directory (the directory in which you installed this fix) and uses any of the files in
   <webMethods_directory>/common/lib, then apply this fix to the other product installation

6. Applying a fix reverts the MWS\server\default\bin\server.properties.[bat|sh],
   MWS\bin\setenv.[bat|sh], MWS\bin\mws.[bat|sh], MWS\server\default\config\wrapper.conf files to
   their default contents.
   If you made changes to these files, create a backup of these files before installing the fix, 
   and change the required values again after the fix installation completes.
	
7. If you are applying this fix to the target installation during a My webMethods Server upgrade, 
   do not initialize the My webMethods Server instance after installation, or after running the 
   migration utility. After the My webMethods Server migration completes sucessfully, reinstall this
   fix and initialize the server instance.
   
8. This fix includes changes that disable Task Engine instances, running on Integration Server. To 
   enable Task Engine on Integration Server, add the task.library.mode.enable = true additional JVM
   property in the custom_wrapper.conf file for Integration Server. The HPSTRA module in Task Engine
   will remain disabled. Note that if you installed Integration Server 10.7 Fix 12 before installing this
   fix Task Engine is already disabled.




7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to 
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in services,
APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

MWS-30770 (MWS_10.7_Fix12)
The instance management commands for My webMethods Server do not provide an option for installing
the latest available fixes when creating or recreating a new server instance, or the OSGi profile
for a server instance.

The issue is resolved. The instance management scripts are enhanced to support the creation of
instances, patched to the latest fix level available in the configured fix repository. Now the
CLI utility for My webMethods Server will invoke Software AG Update Manager and install the latest
available fixes each time you issue one of the following commands:

mws new - to create a new server instance; mws create-osgi-profile - to create an OSGi profile for
a server instance. By default The CLI utility for My webMethods Serve looks for Software AG
Update Manager in the same installation directory as your My webMethods Server installation. You
can specify a different Update Manager location, and further customize the Update Manager
behavior by adding a sum.properties file in <Software AG_installation_directory>/MWS/bin. The
sum.properties file can contain the following parameters:

sum.install.dir=<dir> - Full path to the Update Manager installation directory. Optional. If empty
or not specified, the default is <Software AG_installation_directory>/SAGUpdateManager.
sum.image.location=<path> - Full path to an existing fix image. Optional. sum.empower.user=<user>
- The Update Manager user. Optional. sum.empower.pass=pass_or_pass_file> - The Update Manager
password. Optional. Valid values are: plain text, encypted password, or a password file. Specify
the password file as a fully qualified URI as in
sum.empower.pass=file:/C:/my_files/my_pass_file/sum_pass.txt. Encrypt the pasword using the
procedure, documented in Administering My webMethods Server. In addition, the CLI utility for My
webMethods Server will attempt to call Software AG Update Manager and refresh the metadata it
stores for a server instance each time you issue the delete or delete-osgi-profile commands.

Bundle resolution might fail when deploying war files to My webMethods Server. This issue occurs
with war files that use optional imports, as declared by the default (generated) bundle manifest.

The issue is resolved. To ensure proper bundle resolution, My webMethods Server and Asset Build
Environment are enhanced to provide the option to control how bundles are resolved by the
quinox  platform using BND templates which are applied to multiple components. This option works
in addition  to the current implementation, which generates bundle manifests using a default
template with optional  resolution. Instructions from custom BND files for a particular
application (OSGI-OPT/bnd.bnd)  continue to get merged with the template. Now you can also add
one or more custom BND files to  control the template contents, and apply custom instructions to
multiple applications. Custom  instructions are applied when building assets with Asset Build
Environment or when deploying bundles  to My webMethods Server. For more information about
working with BND templates,  see Administering My webMethods Server.

My webMethods Server might display an 'Authentication statement is too old to be used with value'
error message when a My webMethods user attempts to log in again after the user session expires
due to a period of inactivity. This issue occurs with SAML SSO, when the period of validity of
the SAML assertion of the IDP is longer than the default period for My webMethods Server.

The issue is resolved. My webMethods Server now supports the maxAuthenticationAge property for
SAML SSO to allow setting the same validity period as in the IDP configuration. To modify the
assertion validity time, add the mws.saml.sin.max.authentication.age property to the
custom_wrapper.conf file for My webMethods Server as follows:
wrapper.java.additional.nnn=-Dmws.saml.sin.max.authentication.age=<value_in_seconds>, where nnn
is the unique sequential number of the property. The default validity period is 7200 seconds.

My webMethods Server does not retain the locale configuration for sysadmin after server restart.

The issue is resolved.




WTN-5523 (MWS_10.7_Fix3)
The searchTaskIndexed built-in service in Task Engine might return unexpected results. This issue
occurs when upgrading to Task Engine versions later than 9.7, if the parameter
DoNotShowAcceptedByOthers is set to true in a non-inbox search.

The issue is resolved. In older Task Engine versions, the DoNotShowAcceptedByOthers is ignored
when performing non-inbox searches (with searchUserTasks set to false). For backward
compatibility, now Task Engine provides the task.donotshowacceptedbyothers.disable custom JVM
property. When set to true, Task Engine search services ignore the value of the
DoNotShowAcceptedByOthers parameter.




WTN-5527 (MWS_10.7_Fix3)

The issue is resolved.




WTN-5539 (MWS_10.7_Fix3)
Task Engine might log multiple 'Task is out of date' warnings. This issue occurs when multiple
threads from a custom application access the getTask API and the cached copy of the task that the
API returns is not up to date.

The issue is resolved. Now Task Engine is enhanced to query the database for the latest copy of
the task before returning it through the API. For the fix to take effect, you must add the
task.enable.strong.consistency custom JVM property in the custom_wrapper.conf file for the My
webMethods Server instance that hosts Task Engine, and set the property value to true, as
follows: wrapper.java.additional.nnn=-Dtask.enable.strong.consistency=true, where nnn is the
unique sequential number of the property. Note that using the strong consistency setting might
have performance impact on systems under heavy load.

My webMethods Server might fail to generate the database integrity report and log a misleading
error message with the name and location of the file. This issue occurs when the database
integrity check fails during the initialization of a My webMethods Server instance, started as a
Docker container.

The issue is resolved. My webMethods Server now generates the
<LOGS_VOLUME>/instance_logs/snapshots/db_integrity_report.txt in the designated volume and
directory and logs a proper error message with the file name and location.




MWS-28174 (MWS_10.7_Fix1)
