In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to

APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

WTN-5861 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix4)
Some of the scripts that create Task Engine indexes are not included in the database scripts for MySQL.

The issue is resolved.

MWS-29368 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix3)
The database scripts for My webMethods Server create some of the database indexes in the data
tablespace instead of the index tablespace.

The issue is resolved.


MWS-30078 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix3)
When migrating the My webMethods Server database from version 10.7 or earlier, the Database
Component Configurator registers two additional components. For Oracle and DB2 databases, the
records added to the COMPONENT_EVENT table do not fill the tablespace-related columns, and might
return null when executing a Catalog operation.

The issue is resolved. The tablespace-related columns are now populated properly during migration.


MWS-30107 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix3)
Attempting to re-execute the migration of the database component for My webMethods Server fails
with a "java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: [SoftwareAG][SQLServer JDBC Driver][SQLServer]Column
names in each table must be unique. Column name 'SOURCE' in table 'TBLPORTALVERSION' is specified
more than once." error message. This issue occurs when upgrading from My webMethods Server
version 10.5 to version 10.7 with fix 1.

The issue is resolved.


MWS-30844 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix3)
The Database Component Configurator might set an incorrect database level during My webMethods
Server upgrade.

When migrating the database component for My webMethods Server from a version older than 10.7, the
database scripts for My webMethods Server register two new database components with level 10.7,
regardless of the version you are upgrading to, and cause errors during subsequent runs.

The issue is resolved.


WTN-5418 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix2)
Customer could not archive all tasks using Oracle database. Customer also had deleted task types
without deleting task instances for the particular deleted task type, which prevented tasks from
being archived.

The issues have been resolved.


MWS-26590 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix1)
My webMethods Server version 9.10 does not provide migration scripts for database columns, related
to the UUID functionality which is enabled in a fix.

The issue is resolved. The migration scripts, available in My webMethods Server version 9.10 now
include scripts for UUID columns. The expected db component version when upgrading to My
webMethods Server 9.10 is now 47.1. For the fix to take effect, install the corresponding
required fix (see Requirements), and upgrade the database after the fix installation.


MWS-28568 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix1)
The database migration scripts for My webMethods Server might fail. This issue occurs when
rerunning the Database Component Configurator, and the MWS_UPDATE_PKS (10.5) or MWS_UPDATE_TE
(10.7 or later) database procedures executed partially on a previous run.

The issue is resolved.


MWS-29236 (MWS_10.7_Database_Fix1)
When bootstrapping after upgrade, Common Directory Services in Integration Server might fail to
initialize completely and transfer all available settings from the source version.

The issue is resolved.
