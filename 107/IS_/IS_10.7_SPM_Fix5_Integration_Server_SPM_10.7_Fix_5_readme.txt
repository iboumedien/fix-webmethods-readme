PIE-81002
Updating an SFTP server alias without a client version number through
a template in Command Central or a REST client results in a null pointer
exception. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-92407
High system utilization is reported in CloudStreams instances and Terracotta
servers. 

When two or more Integration Servers are installed with the same Software AG
Platform Manager (SPM), and one of the Integration Servers is down or not
reachable, all the Integration Server runtime-components are removed from the 
cache, which leads to this issue.

This issue is resolved. Now, when one Integration Server is down, only that
Integration Server runtime-component and its parent are removed from cache.

PIE-72589 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix4)
When Platform Manager and Integration Server run together, executing the 
command to stop Integration Server terminates Platform Manager instead. 

When Platform Manager is started as a Windows application using start-up 
scripts, executing the command on the Command Central CLI to stop Integration 
Server terminates Platform Manager instead of Integration Server, which 
continues to run despite executing the stop command. However, this issue does 
not occur when Platform Manager runs as a Windows service. 

The issue is resolved now.

PIE-75029 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix4)
Adding or updating MWS roles to an Integration Server ACL through Command
Central results in an exception.

Adding or updating the "Allowed" or "Denied" list of an ACL with MWS roles
through the Command Central user interface or the CLI results in the
"Allow or Deny Group names are not valid." exception.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-75462 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix4)
Command Central cannot connect to the IP address configured in the 
"watt.server.inetaddress" parameter in Integration Server. 

In Integration Server Administrator, when the watt.server.inetaddress is set to 
an IP address on which Integration Server listens to incoming requests, the 
server is not visible on Command Central. 

This issue is now resolved. 

PIE-77197 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix4)
Migration log is not visible on the Command Central Jobs page.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-77625 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix4)
In Command Central, clicking the Overview or Configuration tab for the Monitor 
component in "Home > Instances > ALL > [instance_name] > Monitor" incorrectly 
throws the "Unexpected component status" although the Monitor component is 
online. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-71693 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix3)
Creating a keystore alias from a template fails.

Creating a keystore alias from a template fails when the template has a Key 
alias with an encrypted password.

This issue is resolved now.

PIE-68030 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix3)
Updates to packages deployed on a cloud environment are not visible.

When packages and configuration assets for an existing solution are deployed to
a cloud environment through Designer, the changes are not displayed in the
cloud environment as the deployment fails intermittently. However, Designer
does not display the status of the deployment, which is misleading.

This issue is now resolved by including additional deployment logs to explain
the cause.

PIE-69862 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix2)
Command Central settings for remote servers do not match those in 
Integration Server.

In Command Central > {IS_Instance} > Integration Server > Configuration > Endpoints, 
the following settings for Remote Servers do not match with Integration Server:

Authentication > Type drop-down shows SSL and BASIC options.
SSL > Key Alias and Keystore Alias are mandatory fields for SSL type 
authentication.

However, in Integration Server settings for Remote Servers, users can only 
choose to use SSL or not, and Key Alias and Keystore Alias are not mandatory 
fields. The settings in Command Central are updated accordingly.

PIE-70523 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix2)
Updates to Integration Server Administrator:

As part of IS_10.7_Core_Fix5, the following additional options are available on
the Server > Quiesce page.

- Disable Audit Logging: This allows you to disable the audit logging in the quiesce
  mode.
- Disable System Tasks interacting with Database: This allows you to disable system
  tasks in the quiesce mode.
- Disable Alerts and Notifications: This allows you to disable alerts and
  notifications in the quiesce mode.
- Disable Statistics Data Collector: This allows you to disable the statistics
  data collector in the quiesce mode.
Select these options for Integration Server to work with a read-only database as
part of a disaster recovery setup.

Note:
It is recommended to enter and exit the quiesce mode in the following manner:
1. Enter the quiesce mode, and then enable the database for read-only operations.
2. Enable the database for read-write operations, and then exit the quiesce mode.

For more information, see "webMethods Integration Server Administrator's Guide".

If you select the "Disable Alerts and Notifications" option on the Server > Quiesce
page and the server is in quiesce mode, alerts are not emitted, and running alerts
and notifier services might throw an exception.

Updates to Deployer:

You can deploy the quiesce settings asset from a source repository to a target
Integration Server. The ID and supported substitution variables in quiesce settings
are:

Asset type ID - isquiescesettings

Substitution Values:

- portAlias: The Integration Server port to use as the quiesce port on the target
  servers. Ensure that the port alias is associated with either the WmRoot or the
  WmPublic package and is of type HTTP or HTTPS.
- systemTasksDisabled: Specifies whether the system tasks on the target servers
  are disabled during quiesce mode. Default is false.
- alertingDisabled: Specifies whether alerts or notifications are disabled on the
  target servers during quiesce mode. Default is false.
- auditingDisabled: Specifies whether audit logging is disabled on the target
  servers during quiesce mode. Default is false.
- statisticsDataCollectorDisabled: Specifies whether the statistics data collector
  is disabled on the target servers during quiesce mode. Default is false.
  
For more information, see the webMethods Deployer User's Guide.

Other changes:

The configuration types and configuration instances in SPM are updated with the
new IS-QUIESCE-OPTIONS.
You can manage or configure the quiesce options for different Integration Server
instances centrally using Command Central.
You can also manage quiesce settings by invoking an Admin API with this end-point:
"http://server:port/admin/quiesce/config".

PIE-68218 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix2)
Applying a Command Central template to add a Common Directory Services (CDS)
member group to an ACL results in java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Applying a Command Central template on an Integration Server instance to add a
CDS member group to an ACL fails despite prefixing the group name with the
"system_" group type in the template.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-63044 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix1)
Command Central does not display API Gateway logs.

If API Gateway is installed along with Integration Server, the API 
Gateway logs are generated in the "<Installation_Directory>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instance_name>/logs/APIGateway" 
folder. However, in Command Central, when you navigate to "Home > Instances > 
ALL > instance_name > Integration Server > Logs > APIGateway", the tab does not 
display the log files.

This issue is resolved now.

PIE-64999 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix1)
The PAUSE and RESUME operations for an Integration Server instance in Command 
Central do not work if the Integration Server instance uses a non-primary, 
SSL-enabled quiesce port.

The issue is resolved now.

PIE-66538 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix1)
Command Central does not display all the supported RDBMS options.

While creating a new instance in Command Central and selecting the RDBMS,
Command Central does not list all the supported RDBMS options.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-67298 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix1)
Software AG Platform Manager (SPM) pings Integration Server (IS) at a much
higher frequency than expected.

The issue is fixed. SPM pings IS at an interval of 60 seconds now.

PIE-66885 (IS_10.7_SPM_Fix1)
When a Command Central maintenance template is executed against an Integration 
Server cluster, the Software AG Platform Manager (SPM) plugin does not invoke 
services on the node specified in the properties file.

The issue is resolved now.
