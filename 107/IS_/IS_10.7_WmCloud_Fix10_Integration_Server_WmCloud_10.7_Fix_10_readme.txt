7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-87692
The on-premise Integration Server monitors the tenant connection status at a
regular interval of 10 minutes, increasing the load on webMethods Cloud. 

The wm.client.integrationlive.admin:scheduleTenantMonitoringTask task 
runs in the on-premise Integration Server at the specified interval of 
10 minutes to monitor the tenant connection status. Since the hybrid 
connectivity alerts are managed by webMethods Cloud, the on-premise 
Integration Server does not have to perform the monitoring that 
increases the load on webMethods Cloud.

This issue is now resolved. Now, the on-premise Integration Server does not 
handle the alerts for tenant connections.

PIE-82574 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix9)
Under heavy load, an on-premises Integration Server might take a long time to
send responses to the Cloud. 

Previously, each webMethods Cloud account on an on-premises Integration Server
used a single session to send responses to the Cloud. Under heavy load, this
configuration might create resource contention and increase response time. 

To address this issue, an on-premises Integration Server now creates a
session pool for each webMethods Cloud account and uses sessions in the pool to
send responses to the Cloud. The server configuration parameter 
watt.wmcloud.um.sessionPool.maxCount determines the maximum number
of sessions in the pool. The default value is 3. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. However, the webMethods Cloud accounts on the on-premises
Integration Server must be disabled and then enabled for changes to the
parameter to take effect. 

PIE-78830 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
webMethods.io Integration requests time out without an error message.

In a hybrid integration environment, a request from webMethods.io Integration 
to an on-premise Integration Server fails when the response payload exceeds 
the configured maximum buffer size. However, Integration Server does not 
send the exception to webMethods.io Integration but retries to send the 
response based on the watt.wmcloud.sendResponse.retryCount server 
configuration parameter and then fails. Hence, webMethods.io Integration 
requests time out without an exception.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server does not retry publishing
the response when the response exceeds the maximum buffer size
but sends an exception to webMethods.io Integration.

PIE-81443 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
While monitoring tenant connections, Integration Server retains the session 
context even if there are errors after creating a session context, which 
might cause a session leakage.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server removes the session context 
for errors as well.

PIE-81694 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
Integration Server logs the "Unable to create an SMTP client instance for a 
hybrid connectivity alert: The email properties are not configured." error when 
an account or tenant connection is disconnected or restored. 

Integration Server uses the email notification settings configured in 
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Resources to send the hybrid 
connectivity alert mails to the user. If the email notification settings are 
not configured, and the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications 
server configuration parameter has a value other than 'alert' or 'none', 
Integration Server logs the error when an account or tenant connection is 
disconnected or restored. 

This issue is now resolved. Now, the default value of 
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications server configuration 
parameter is 'alert'.

PIE-81971 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
A Cloud account cannot be deleted on the on-premise Integration Server if the
tenant on webMethods Cloud is not available. 

A cloud configuration change, such as deleting an account, made on the
on-premise Integration Server cannot complete if the on-premise server cannot
connect to the tenant on the Cloud. 

Now, Integration Server continues with on-premise configuration changes related
to Cloud without requiring a successful response from the Cloud tenant. Changes
to cloud accounts, applications, and the tenant connection alias can be made on
the on-premise Integration Server and then pushed to the Cloud. However, if a
connection to the Cloud is not available, the cloud configuration on the
on-premise Integration Server becomes out of sync with the Cloud tenant. To get
the items on Cloud synchronized with the on-premise configuration, edit the
account or application in the Cloud. 

PIE-82574 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
Under heavy load, an on-premises Integration Server might take a long time to 
send responses to the Cloud. 

Previously, each web Methods Cloud account on an on-premises Integration Server 
used a single session to send responses to the Cloud. Under heavy load, this 
configuration might create resource contention and increase response time. 

To address this issue, an on-premises Integration Server now creates a session 
pool for each webMethods Cloud account and uses sessions in the pool to send 
responses to the Cloud. The server configuration parameter, 
watt.wmcloud.um.sessionPool.maxCount determines the maximum number of sessions 
in the pool. The default value is 3. 

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to 
take effect. However, the webMethods Cloud accounts on the on-premises 
Integration Server must be disabled and then enabled for changes to the 
parameter to take effect.

PIE-83185 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
Integration Server Administrator exposes tenant connection passwords.

In Integration Server Administrator > webmethods Cloud > Tenant connections, the
password used to create a tenant connection is exposed while editing the
connection. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-83656 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
When multiple webMethods Cloud accounts with the same alias are associated with
multiple tenants, surplus sessions are created. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-83687 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
A session leak may occur if the Enable link is repeatedly clicked for an enabled
account on the WmCloud > Accounts page in Integration Server Administrator. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-84479 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
Integration Server throws "[ISS.0026.9201] Unknown service:
wm.client.integrationlive.admin:executeTenantConnectionMonitor despite 
disabling the WmCloud package".

When you disable the WmCloud package in Integration Server, the server should
automatically disable the startup services related to the WmCloud package.
However, the server does not disable the 
wm.client.integrationlive.admin:scheduleTenantMonitoringTask startup service,
which results in the error. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-84595 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
Session leak may occur when constantly refreshing the webMethods Cloud >
Accounts page. 

Repeatedly clicking the link in the Enabled column for an account on the
webMethods Cloud > Accounts page may cause a session leak for the Universal
Messaging server used to route messages to and from the tenant for the
on-premises Integration Server. 

Now, if an action results in the change to an account's enabled status, the
link in the Enabled column is disabled until the action completes. 

PIE-84618 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
A tenant connection alias that specified a non-existent webMethods Cloud URL was
created as enabled but should be disabled. 

When using the webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections page to create a tenant
connection alias, specifying an invalid URL for the webMethods Cloud URL results
in an enabled tenant connection alias but should not. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-84855 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
Integration Server Administrator displays an incomplete message when deleting a
tenant. 

After attempts to delete a tenant on the webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections
page, Integration Server Administrator displays just the name of the tenant
without any context. This can be confusing if the tenant connection cannot be
deleted because it is being used by an account. 

Now, Integration Server Administrator displays clearer error messages when
attempts to delete a connection alias succeed or fail. 

PIE-85000 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
Hybrid requests might fail because of a NullPointerException that sometimes
occurs after disabling and then enabling a webMethods Cloud account on an
on-premises Integration Server. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-85142 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix8)
When webMethods Cloud is unreachable, disabling a webMethods Cloud account
results in an open response session, leading to session leakage. 
 
This issue is resolved. Now, when you disable a webMethods Cloud account, 
the on-premise Integration Server closes the response session irrespective 
of the webMethods Cloud status.

PIE-81172 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix7)
Integration Server now provides alerts for hybrid connectivity.

A new channel, "Hybrid Connections" is added for hybrid connectivity alerts,
which are generated for the following events:
- Tenant connection disconnected
- Tenant connection restored
- Account disconnected
- Account restored

To enable hybrid connectivity alerts, add the hybrid connection channel
ID (14) to the emissionChannels and systemNotifierChannels arrays in
the alertSetings.json file in the
Integration Server_directory\instances\instance_name\config directory.

When an account connection or a tenant connection is disconnected or
restored, Integration Server notifies the user through a notification in
Integration Server Administrator followed by an email.
You can configure the hybrid connectivity notifications using
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications server configuration
parameter and the recipients of the notification emails using
the watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail server configuration parameter.

Integration Server uses the email notification settings configured in
Integration Server Administrator > Settings > Resources.

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.mail
Specifies the list of email addresses to which Integration Server sends emails
about errors and warnings related to the connection status between
IntegrationServer and webMethods Cloud. Use a semicolon (;) as a delimiter
to specify multiple email addresses. By default, the parameter value is blank.

watt.wmcloud.hybridConnectivityAlert.notifications
Specifies whether Integration Server generates notifications and notifies
users when a tenant connection or an account for webMethods Cloud is
disconnected or restored. The parameter can have one of the following values:
- alert: Integration Server displays a notification in Integration Server
Administrator.
- email: Integration Server sends an email to the user.
- none: Integration Server does not notify the user.

Note: If you are using any value other than alert, email, or none, Integration
Server notifies the user through a notification in Integration Server
Administrator, followed by an email. By default, the parameter value is alert.

Integration Server restart is not required for changes to these parameters to
take effect.

In addition, the HybridConnections health indicator is added to track the
status of hybrid connections.
HybridConnections: Checks all the listed tenant connection
aliases and associated accounts for webMethods Cloud. Returns a status of
UP if all of the listed tenant connections and associated accounts are UP.
Returns a status of DOWN if any of the listed tenant or account connections are
down. The health indicator includes individual statuses for tenant connections
and associated accounts, along with the overall hybrid connection status.
If an enabled tenant connection does not have an account alias or the account
alias is not enabled, the health indicator does not list the tenant alias.
If a tenant connection is disabled and the associated account is enabled, the
health indicator shows the account status.

PIE-78153 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix6)
Service executions on the on-premise Integration Server result in 
increased logging in the server log.

For example:
[ISS.0021.8018I] Received request ID <REQ_ID> to execute service 
<SERVICE_NAME> for application <APP_NAME> using account <ACCOUNT_NAME>.
[ISS.0021.8020I] Executed service <SERVICE_NAME> for request ID <REQ_ID>. 
Session ID: <SESSION_ID>.

This issue is resolved.
Now, Integration Server logs the service execution details only when 
you set the WmCloud logging facility to the Trace level.

PIE-78298 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix6)
Service executions on an on-premise Integration Server result in increased 
logging in the server log. 

During WmCloud package startup, Integration Server may log an error message 
like the following: 

<timestamp> [ISS.0028.0012I] (tid=<thread id>) WmCloud: Startup service (
wm.client.integrationlive.admin:loadTenantAccountInfo) 

<timestamp> }}{{{} \\\ISS.0021.6004E\\\{} (tid=<thread id>) An error occurred 
while loading information from the webMethods Cloud environment. No tenant 
aliases are enabled. 

This error message is meaningful only if Integration Server is used as an on-
premise server with webMethods Cloud. This message can be safely ignored if it 
occurs on an Integration Server that is not used with webMethods Cloud. 

This issue is resolved. Now, the log level for several log messages produced by 
Integration Server during startup is adjusted. ISS.0021.6004 is no longer 
an error when all cloud tenants are disabled. Additionally, no INFO log 
messages are produced when an on-premise service executes. Set the logging 
level for the Integration Cloud (0021) logging facility to DEBUG to produce log 
messages with each service execution.

PIE-78317 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix6)
Integration Server allows uploading applications to Integration Cloud 
through a disabled tenant connection.

Integration Server requires a tenant connection that is valid and 
enabled to upload applications to Integration Cloud. However, 
Integration Server Administrator displays a successful message while 
uploading an application for a disabled tenant connection.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server displays the 
"Tenant connection is not enabled." message for a disabled tenant 
connection.

PIE-78577 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix6)
When an on-premise Integration Server establishes a session with webMethods
Cloud to send a response, an error, such as a missing queue, results in the
session remaining open instead of being closed. 

Now, if an error occurs when establishing a session to send a response to
webMethods Cloud, the on-premise Integration  Server closes the session,
preventing session leaks. 

PIE-78790 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix6)
A webMethods Cloud account on an on-premise Integration Server waits for 
15 minutes before reconnecting to webMethods Integration Cloud, 
resulting in increased downtime.

Integration Server uses the value of the Maximum Reconnection Attempts 
field specified in webMethods Cloud > Accounts > Create On-Premise 
Account > Account Settings to limit the reconnection attempts. 
By default, Integration Server makes five attempts to reconnect to 
webMethods Integration Cloud after waiting for a random time that 
ranges between 1 to 15 minutes, resulting in increased downtime.

The issue is resolved. Now, the account frequently attempts to 
reconnect to webMethods Cloud with a random interval between 
100 milliseconds to 10 seconds for the first two minutes and 
then waits for a period of 30 to 60 seconds before attempting 
to retry the connection.

PIE-78907 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix6)
webMethods Cloud requests fail with timeout errors when request timeout is set
to 5 minutes or higher. 

After applying a WmCloud fix that contains PIE-75389, webMethods Cloud accounts
that use a request timeout value of 300000 milliseconds (i.e. 5 minutes) or
higher cannot receive Cloud requests. The requests fail with the following
exception: 
"com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nTransactionException: The time out specified exceeds
the servers" 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-75389 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix5)
webMethods Cloud integrations that invoke on-premise services fail
intermittently with timeout errors. 

When services fail with a timeout error, an exception like the following may
appear for a failed transaction in the Cloud dashboard: 

com.softwareag.is.integrationlive.IntegrationLiveException: Error occurred while
executing service <serviceName> with request ID <requestID>. The on-premise
Integration Server did not respond within the configured request timeout of
<requestTimeout> milliseconds. Check on-premise logs. 

To address the timeout errors, this fix improves the response time by decreasing
the time between when the on-premise Integration Server enqueues the response
and when Cloud receives the response. This is accomplished by adding a Universal
Messaging queue for each Cloud Integration Server. When sending the response to
the Cloud, the on-premise Integration Server sends the response to the dedicated
queue specified in the request. Effectively, this distributes the response load
across multiple queues, preventing a delay when there is only one queue to
receive the response. Previously, the on-premise Integration Server sent every
response to the same queue associated with the tenant. 

The fix to the on-premise Integration Server has a companion fix for the Cloud.
The Cloud portion of the fix will be implemented and enabled only after making
sure this on-premise fix is applied. After applying the fix, please contact
webMethods support to have this feature enabled for your tenant. 

PIE-76531 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix5)
Transient network-related issues cause timeout errors, resulting in the
intermittent failure of hybrid integrations. 

webMethods Cloud integrations that invoke on-premise services fail
intermittently with timeout errors. An exception like the following may appear
for a failed transaction in the Cloud dashboard: 

com.softwareag.is.integrationlive.IntegrationLiveException: Error occurred while
executing service <serviceName> with request ID <requestID>. The on-premise
Integration Server did not respond within the configured request timeout of
<requestTimeout> milliseconds. Check on-premise logs. 

The errors may occur when transient, network-related issues cause the on-premise
Integration Server to lose its connection to the Cloud. Any response that was
ready to be sent to the Cloud is lost. 

The resolution for PIE-75389 fix addressed some type of these timeouts. However,
to further address the timeout errors, connection leak, and lost response
messages, Integration Server now uses a transactional publish when sending
responses to the Cloud. The transactional publish includes a built-in mechanism
to recover from intermittent network errors. Additionally, Integration Server
automatically retries any failed transactional publish. 

Use the following server configuration parameters to configure the retry
functionality for publishing responses to the Cloud. 

watt.wmcloud.sendResponse.retryCount - Specifies the maximum number of retry
attempts that an on-premise Integration Server makes when a failure occurs when
sending a response to the Cloud. The default value is 3. A value of 0 indicates
that Integration Server will not attempt any retries. Integration Server does
not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter to take effect. 

watt.wmcloud.sendResponse.retryDelay - Specifies the number of milliseconds
that an on-premise Integration Server waits before making another retry attempt
after a publish attempt fails. The default value is 1000 (i.e., 1 second).
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

If the maximum retry attempts have been made and publishing a response to the
Cloud still fails, the on-premise Integration Server writes an error to the
server log. 

To assist with debugging the publish failures, this fix introduces additional
logging when the sever log facility 0021 Integration Cloud is set to the Info
level or more verbose level. 

PIE-78419 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix5)
Session leak when Universal Messaging server used for hybrid connectivity is
missing a required queue.
 
When the Universal Messaging server that facilitates communication between the
on-premises Integration Server and webMethods Cloud is missing a required queue
(specifically the queue from which the on-premises Integration Server retrieves
requests from webMethods Cloud), the on-premise Integration Server continually
attempts to reconnect resulting in sessions that are neither disposed of nor
closed. This leads to a constant accumulation of open connections which
eventually leads to resource exhaustion and Universal Messaging server becoming
unresponsive.

Now, when a required Universal Messaging queue is missing, the on-premises
Integration Server closes sessions that attempted to establish a connection to
the missing queue. This prevents the accumulation of sessions and resource exhaustion.

PIE-76775 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix4)
When CSRF Guard is disabled, the WmCloud > Accounts page in Integration Server
Administrator displayed an account as enabled even after the account was
disabled. 

This issue is resolved.

Note: This fix extends PIE-74691 which resolved the same issue when CSRF Guard
was enabled. 

PIE-71967 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix3)
An on-premise Integration Server executes a request from a Cloud application
even though the associated account is disabled. 

When a webMethods Cloud account is disabled, the on-premise Integration Server
should not execute a service request from a Cloud application associated with
the disabled account. 

Now, when an account is disabled, a request from the Cloud for an on-premise
service associated with the account will fail because the request timeout
elapses. 

PIE-72393 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix3)
An error occurs when saving webMethods Cloud Docker services.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-73245 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix3)
When CSRF guard is enabled, an error occurs when saving or deleting an account
on the webMethods Cloud > Accounts page. 

This issue has been corrected.

PIE-74686 and PIE-74691 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix3)
In Integration Server Administrator, the WmCloud > Accounts page displayed an
account as enabled even after the account was disabled. 

This issue is resolved. The WmCloud > Accounts page displays the correct status
for an account. 

PIE-74877 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix3)
Integration Server Administrator indicates that a webMethods Cloud account is
enabled after it has been disabled. 

After using the legacy Integration Server Administrator to disable a webMethods
Cloud account, the webMethods Cloud > Accounts page displays "Yes" in the
Enabled column for the account. This is incorrect. 

Note: This issue does not occur in the new Integration Server Administrator.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-69998 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix2)
An on-premise Integration Server might lose Cloud requests sent while it
experiences intermittent connectivity errors. 

An on-premise Integration Server uses a non-transactional reader when reading
requests from webMethods Cloud. If the on-premise Integration Server experiences
intermittent connectivity issues, it may not receive Cloud requests sent while
connectivity issues were occurring. 

To resolve this issue, the on-premise Integration Server now uses a
transactional reader to read requests from webMethods Cloud. When using a
transactional reader, the requests are removed from storage only when they are
read and acknowledged by the on-premise Integration Server or if the request
expires. 

PIE-72610 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix2)
The on-premise Integration Server sometimes does not accept Cloud requests.

The on-premise Integration Server periodically checks a webMethods Cloud
listener for a webMethods Cloud account for activity. If the listener has not
received any requests for the maximum idle time (which is controlled by the
watt.wmcloud.listeners.maxIdleTime), Integration Server uses the same thread
that checked the listener to stop and close the listener. Sometimes, the
listener takes a long time to close. During this time period, the on-premise
Integration Server does not have any listener for that webMethods Cloud account.
The on-premise Integration Server cannot receive any request sent from the Cloud
for that webMethods Cloud account. 

To resolve this issue, when Integration Server identifies an inactive webMethods
Cloud listener, Integration Server hands the inactive listener to another thread
to handle its closure, and, at the same time, uses the thread that checked the
listener to create a new listener for that webMethods Cloud account. 

PIE-73087 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix2)
The webMethods Cloud > Tenant Connections pages for creating and editing tenant
connections is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. 

This issue has been resolved.

Important! To fully resolve this issue, you must apply both the Integration
Server Core fix and the WmCloud fix that include PIE-73087. 

PIE-70842 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix1)
Information is missing or unavailable from webMethods Cloud pages.

The following issues were observed in the webMethods Cloud pages in Integration 
Server Administrator.

- The Applications page does not display applications if additional files or 
directories existed in the following directory and these files/directories were 
not created through the use of Integration Server Administrator:
/<installation_directory>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instanceName>/config/integrationlive/applications

- Applications migrated from earlier versions of webMethods Cloud were not 
migrated properly which prevented  the applications from appearing in the 
Applications menu.

- If the file containing tenant configurations does not contain any tenants, the 
Create Tenant Connection link on the Tenant connections page is disabled.

These issues have all been corrected.

PIE-70161 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix1)
Integration Server does not write a message to the server log when the 
IDataCoder.readFromFile method encounters an error when opening a file.

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server now logs the following Trace and 
Debug level messages when IDataCoder.readFromFile cannot open a file because of 
an error:

[ISC.0076.0008T] (tid=#) XMLCoder decode exception: <exception>
[ISC.0076.0008D] (tid=##) XMLCoder decode exception: <exception>

For example:

[ISC.0076.0008T] (tid=#) XMLCoder decode exception: com.wm.util.coder.InvalidDatatypeException: [ISC.0076.9002] incorrect IDataXMLCoder file format: no element 'IDataXMLCoder' found
[ISC.0076.0008D] (tid=##) XMLCoder decode exception: IDataCoder.readFromFile() error reading: <fileName> [ISC.0076.9002] incorrect IDataXMLCoder file format: no element 'IDataXMLCoder' found

PIE-69720 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix1)
Updating a webMethods Cloud tenant connection results in
java.util.ConcurrentModificationException.

Updating the webMethods Cloud URL or user credentials for a tenant connection
in 'Integration Server Administrator > webMethods Cloud > Tenant connections'
results in java.util.ConcurrentModificationException.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-68485 (IS_10.7_WmCloud_Fix1)
Change to allow multiple tenants to be configured for an on-premise Integration
Server receiving requests from webMethods Cloud. 

Prior to PIE-68485, only one tenant could be configured for an on-premise
Integration Server that received requests from webMethods Cloud. (The tenant
configuration specifies the credentials used to listen for requests.) As a
result, each account on the on-premise Integration Server used the same tenant
credentials to listen for requests. (An account specifies the connection
parameters needed to access webMethods Cloud.) However, this introduced the
limitation where the same set of tenant credentials was used for executing all
service requests that originated in webMethods Cloud on the on-premise
Integration Server. Additionally, the requirement that each cloud tenant have
its own on-premise Integration Server was burdensome. 

Now, an on-premise Integration Server can have multiple tenants and each tenant
can have a separate set of credentials. Each account on an on-premise
Integration Sever is still associated with a single tenant, however, you can
choose which tenant the account uses. Multiple accounts can use the same tenant. 

This fix introduces the following changes:
- Multiple tenants can be created for an on-premise Integration Server.
- Each account can now be associated with a different tenant. However, the
applies to new accounts only. An account that existed prior to the application
of PIE-68485 can use the default tenant only. 
- The webMethods Cloud > Settings page is now webMethods Cloud > Tenant
Connections. 
-  Each on-premise Integration Server now includes a pre-defined tenant named
"default". The default tenant cannot be deleted but can be edited and
renamed. 
- Tenant credentials specified on the webMethods Cloud > Settings page are
preserved in the default tenant. 
-  Existing accounts on the on-premise Integration Server use the default
tenant. This cannot be changed. Only accounts created after PIE-68485 is applied
can use a tenant besides the default. 
- The configuration information for creating a tenant on the webMethods Cloud >
Tenant Connections page is the same as on the previous webMethods Cloud >
Settings page with the addition of an Alias field to provide a name for the
tenant connection. 
- Tenants can be enabled/disabled. A tenant connection can also be tested. 
- When uploading an application via the webMethods Cloud > Applications > Upload
Application page, Integration Server Administrator displays the tenant
associated with the account. 

After applying a fix that includes PIE-68485, ensure that the default tenant is
enabled and connected to webMethods Cloud.
