5.0 Fix Contents

This fix addresses the following issues:

WGL-368
My webMethods Server might fail to display server status on the Servers 
administration page in My webMethods. 

My webMethods Server might send an incorrect HTTP request with two 
cookie headers instead of a combined cookie header to Integration 
Server and fail to display the contents of the Servers page. This 
issue occurs when you use My webMethods Server together with a stateless 
Integration Server cluster and a load balancer. 

The issue is resolved.

My webMethods Server has very slow response times when you log in to
