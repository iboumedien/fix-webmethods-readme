7.0 Fix Contents


SBL-379
Updated copyright notes, vendor and product names for IBM rebranding.

SBL-366(SBL_6.0_SP3_Fix14)
In webMethods Siebel Adapter, the adapter connections cannot be
enabled on Integration Server 9.7 running on Linux operating system.

This issue occurs because Integration Server 9.7 for Linux does
not contian the WmWin32 package.

This issue is resolved. The adapter now provides classes from the
WmWin32 package that are required to enable adapter connections
on Integration Server 9.7 for Linux. 

1-1Z8JDK (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix12)
EAI webMethods Transports intermittently throw an error when 
there is high load on the Siebel Server.

When EAI webMethods Transports are used for Siebel-to-webMethods 
communication, JNI calls to create the JVM fail intermittently 
with the error "Can't create JVM". This error eventually causes 
the Siebel Object Manager to crash.

The issue is resolved. JNI calls to create a JVM complete 
successfully. wmISTransport.dll has been modified so that before 
invoking a JVM, a check is made if a JVM is already loaded 
within the current process, using the JNI call 
"JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs". If a JVM is already loaded, it is used. 
It also checks for system resources before making JNI Call 
"JNI_CreateJavaVM".

This issue is now resolved.

1-1RMZUR (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix11)
webMethods Siebel Adapter cannot query records for business
component.

When a Siebel business component and additional business
components are linked via an intersection table, the Siebel
Adapter Query service cannot query the parent to retrieve the
child based on the context set at the parent level.

This issue is resolved. You can now configure a Query service
that successfully navigates from the parent business object to
the child business components that are linked via an
intersection table.

1-1RH8N8 (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix10)
The webMethods Siebel Adapter returns incorrect value for the
fields of type DTYPE_MVG (java.lang.object).

On the Siebel Server, if the data type of any field is not
defined, webMethods Siebel Adapter considers such fields as
DTYPE_MVG. When you retrieve data from the Siebel Server, the
Siebel Adapter services return incorrect values from DTYPE_MVG
type fields.

This issue is now resolved. The Siebel Adapter returns
appropriate values from the DTYPE_MVG type fields.

1-1QVVOX (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix10)
webMethods Siebel Adapter does not retrieve the system fields
other than the ID field.

In the Search Tab of the Siebel Adapter service, the webMethods
Siebel Adapter retrieves only the ID field and does not retrieve
the Created, Created By, Updated, Updated By, Mod ID, and
Conflict ID fields.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1QG98B (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix9)
Out-of-memory error received with EAI webMethods Transport
service.

When you are using the EAI webMethods Transports on Siebel
server and invoke the SyncISInvokeG business service method, the
SyncISInvokeG method intermittently throws an error:
"InvokeStatusMsg: JVM Out-Of-Memory."


1-1OXVIP (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix8)
Error when importing Siebel transport sif file to Siebel 8.0.

While importing wmISTransport.sif to Siebel 8.0, Siebel throws
the error: "<field> is a required field, please enter value for
<field>." This error occurs because Siebel 8.0 introduced some
new required fields for their project that were optional in
previous versions.

This issue is resolved. Now the wmISTransport.sif file contains
default values for all new required fields.

1-1OXVI9 (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix8)
For some business objects and business components, the Siebel
Adapter throws a non-fatal exception that says
setRepositoryContext() cannot be called on certain business
components/objects.

Because setRepositoryContext is only valid for repository
business components, any BC that is not in the repository will
cause this error.

This issue is resolved. The Siebel Adapter now handles this
condition internally.

1-1OXVIP(SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix8)
Error when importing Siebel transport sif file to Siebel 8.0.

While importing wmISTransport.sif to Siebel 8.0, Siebel throws
the error: "<field> is a required field, please enter value for
<field>." This error occurs because Siebel 8.0 introduced some
new required fields for their project that were optional in
previous versions.

This issue is resolved. Now the wmISTransport.sif file contains
default values for all new required fields.

1-1OXVFR (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix8)
Siebel Adapter throws an error while creating a connection with
Siebel 8.0.

The errors are as follows and indicates an issue with Siebel
Server 8.0:

<Exception>
<Major No.>256</Major No.><Minor No.>22055</Minor No.><Message>
An end of file error has occurred. Please continue or ask your
systems administrator to check your application configuration if
the problem persists.(SBL-DAT-00393)</Message><DetailedMessage>
Unknown<DetailedMessage>
</Exception>

To resolve this issue, the customer must install a Siebel fix
QF0008 which is attached with SR 38-3320061241 and CR 12-1J0HCWP
in Siebel Support. Installing the Siebel fix on Siebel Server 8.0
resolves this issue with the Siebel Adapter.

1-1MJQW1 (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix7)
Error thrown while inserting a record that has its first field
value as null.

Siebel Adapter throws an error when inserting a record that has
its first field value as null. This happens because it
incorrectly assumes that the first field of a record always
contains a definite value.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1K9ZFV (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix6)
In WmISTransport, when you execute syncISInvoke function on
Siebel Server 7.7.2.3 and above, where "EnableCSIScripting=True",
the WmISTransport throws the following error:
"ISTransport.syncISInvoke() :
ErrorType(com.wm.app.b2b.server.ServiceException) :
java.lang.NumberFormatException: null".

In Siebel server 7.7.2.3 and above, Siebel introduces a new
feature called "Engine Settings" which can be enabled by adding
this entry "EnableCLIScripting=TRUE" in the tools.cfg file. When
"EnableCLIScripting=TRUE" some functions of EAI webMethods
Transport will not work and the WmISTransport throws an error.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1ISC6B (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix5)
After migrating Siebel Adapter 6.0 SP2 to SP3, the user
credential fields that override the connection at run time,
appear incorrectly.

The password field appears as Password while the username field
does not appear at all.

This issue is now resolved. Now, the password field appears
correctly whereas for the username field to appear, you need to
reload the values.

1-1HGPWX (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix5)
Error thrown when processing data in a multiple repository
context wherein, one repository has a field definition with a
picklist while the other repository has a field definition
without a picklist.

Consider you have a repository R1 with a field definition NX BOD
without a picklist, and another repository R2 with a field
definition with the same name NX BOD with a picklist. Now, if you
try to process data in the field NX BOD in R1, an error as below
is thrown:

"Unable to find PickList 'NX BOD'"

This happens because the Siebel Adapter incorrectly considers
that the field definition in R1 is with a picklist.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1GTGIL (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix4)
In webMethods Siebel Adapter, an error is thrown when you select
the default value or null value for a field that has a pick list.

This happens because at run time Siebel Adapter fails to pick the
default value or the null value assigned to the field.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1HR84R (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix4)
In webMethods Siebel Adapter, while running multiple services at
a time, the user credentials of some of the services get
overridden by the user credentials of other services running at
the same time.

This happens because Siebel Adapter creates only one variable
instance for all the services. This leads to the overriding of
the credentials for some services, at run time.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1DM5O4 (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix3)
The webMethods Siebel Adapter does not retrieve the system fields
other than the ID field.

In the Output Mapping Tab of an adapter service, the webMethods
Siebel Adapter retrieves only the ID field and does not retrieve
the fields Created, Created By, Updated, Updated By, Mod ID, and
Conflict ID.

This issue is now resolved.

1-1E2S3E (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix3)
When IS debug level is set to 3, the Siebel adapter logs large
number of debug messages.

When IS debug level is set to 3 and any Siebel operation is
performed, Siebel adapter logs hundreds of debug messages.

This issue is now resolved. Now if IS debug level is set to 3,
only relevant debug messages will be logged.

1-154ETT (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix1)
In webMethods Siebel Adapter 6.0 SP3, bounded and unbounded pick
lists throw errors when the values have special characters.

Bounded and unbounded pick lists throw errors when the values
have special characters. Also, unbounded pick lists do not allow
the insertion of a new value in the business component.

This issue is now resolved.

1-15DCXR (SBL_6-0_SP3_Fix1)
In webMethods Siebel Adapter, the destroy connection method
always calls the garbage collection method.

The destroy connection method in the webMethods Siebel Adapter
always invokes the JVM garbage collection method, resulting in a
performance issue. The garbage collection is now performed by the
JVM.

This issue is now resolved.
