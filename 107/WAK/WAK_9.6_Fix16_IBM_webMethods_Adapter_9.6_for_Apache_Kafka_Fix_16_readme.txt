WAK-479
In IBM webMethods Adapter for Apache Kafka, running the
wm.adapter.wmkafka.serde:registerSerializer public service fails with invalid
className error.

This issue is now resolved.

WAK-478
In IBM webMethods Adapter for Apache Kafka, the debug messages are logged when
the log level is configured for INFO.

This issue is now resolved.

WAK-477
IBM webMethods Adapter for Apache Kafka provides a mechanism to handle the poison
pill scenario by leveraging an error-handling deserializer. The poison pill
scenario occurs when a record published to a Kafka topic continuously fails to
be consumed. This occurs when the producer and consumer are configured with
incompatible serializers and deserializers.

Perform the following steps to enable an error-handling deserializer:
1. Set watt.adapter.kafka.use.error.handling.deserializer property to true in
Integration Server Administrator, navigate to Settings > Extended.
2. Edit the relevant consumer connection to specify a custom service to process
the record with the error in the "Deserializer Error Handler" field
3. Enable the relevant consumer connection.

Note:
1. Consumer records with errors will not be passed to the consumer service or
configured listeners.
2. If the watt.adapter.kafka.use.error.handling.deserializer property is set to
true and the flow service is not specified in the "Deserializer Error Handler"
field, then the records with errors will be lost. The user may have to reset the
consumer offset to a prior value to read them again.
3. For more information about the input structure of the record with the error
received from the deserializer error handler, see the
wm.adapter.wmkafka.serde.specifications:deserializerErrorHandler sample service
specification.

WAK-447
When IBM webMethods Adapter for Apache Kafka package is loaded, the 'Adapter
Runtime: Duplicate facility 507' warning appears in the server log.

WAK-440
In IBM webMethods Adapter for Apache Kafka, continuous commits to the Kafka
topics are performed even when the listener consumes no data.

This issue is now resolved.

However, note that when auto-commit is enabled, the Adapter for Apache Kafka
consumer commits offsets based on the defined auto-commit interval, regardless
of whether the Kafka listener is consuming any messages.

WAK-436

Apache Kafka producer service and deserialized using another client which uses
non-ByteBuffer Double APIs, a value mismatch occurs.
