In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

PIF-16454
The webMethods Broker JMS Resource Adapter failed to work with JBoss EAP 7.4. The following errors
were observed in the JBoss log file:
- Failed to start service: No message listener of type javax.jms.MessageListener found in resource
  adapter webm-jmsra.rar.
- Version.getMajorVersion() failed: Missing manifest file for URL.

This issue occurred because the resource adapter included its own copy of the `jms.jar` file, which
conflicted with the `jms.jar` file provided by JBoss modules. To resolve this, the Broker JMS
Resource Adapter no longer includes the `jms.jar` file. Instead, it expects a compatible JMS 1.1 or
JMS 2.0 JAR file to be available in the JBoss environment. Additionally, the Broker JMS Client JAR
file now includes a `version.properties` file, which is used to retrieve version information before
the code attempts to access the manifest file.

This issue is now resolved.

PIF-15875
Broker Java Admin API now supports reporting storage cache utilization. API
BrokerServerClient.getStorageStats() now contains the following additional fields:
- sessions[].max_cache_kbytes -- (long) Maximum storage cache size.
- sessions[].current_cache_kbytes_inuse -- (long) Current storage cache size in use.

Broker Server configuration parameter 'max_cache_size' default values are also changed:
- Configuration storage default cache size is now 64 MB.
- Run-time data storage default cache size is 50% of the physical memory on the host machine or 50%
of the value specified in the max-memory-size parameter, whichever is smaller.
