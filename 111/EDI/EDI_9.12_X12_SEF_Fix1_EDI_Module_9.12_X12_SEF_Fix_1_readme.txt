EEO-4645

The sef file was not containing description and an alternate name of a segment.
This issue is now resolved and the sef file now contains a description and an
alternate name of a segment. Currently, sef schema with description and an
alternate name of a segment is supported for only standard X12 version 7050,
7060, and 8010.
To use sef file with description, please set EDI Configuration property
InstallSEFSchemaWithDescription as true along with EDI Configuration property 
EDISchemaSource as SEF. When InstallSEFSchemaWithDescription set as true while 
Creating a Flat File Schema from a SEF File the sef file is read from this
location packages\WmEDI\pub\SEFS\X12_SefDesc
instead of packages\WmEDI\pub\SEFS\X12.
