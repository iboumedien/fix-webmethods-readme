7.0 Fix Contents

DTS-3341
Some HTML elements in Integration Server Administrator did not have an
aria-label attribute. 

The aria-label attribute has now been added.

DTS-3352
On the Services tab of the Dashboard, the Services Instances tab does not reload
after switching to another tab and then switching back. 

This issue is now resolved. 

DTS-3353
Disable autocomplete for the Integration Server Administrator login page.

Autocomplete is now disabled for the form fields Username and Password on the
Integration Server Administrator login page. However, browsers might still have
autocomplete enabled, resulting in the browser prompting users to save username
and password. For information about disabling autocomplete or autofill for a
browser, refer to the browser documentation. 

DTS-3428
In the Service detail page in Server Monitoring, the Logged fields table does
not sort by column. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-3433
Integration Server Administrator is not legible when using a browser that uses a
dark theme. 

Integration Server Administrator only supports the light theme for a browser.
However, Integration Server should be legible and display correctly in a browser
that uses the dark theme. 

Integration Server Administrator now renders properly in a browser that uses the
dark theme. 

DTS-3492
Integration Server Administrator displays the redirect URL in the browser
address bar when a user logs out of an Integration Server configured for single
sign-on. 

When a user logs out from an Integration Server Administrator configured for
single sign-on, Integration Server Administrator redirects the request. During
the redirect, the address bar in the browser contains the redirect URL. This is
a security vulnerability. 

Now, Integration Server maintains the redirect URL and only supplies it to
Integration Server Administrator when required. 

PIE-95887
Users can create and manage configurations with secrets even if the
vault server configured for Integration Server is unavailable. 

The issue is resolved now.

PIE-99687
Creating a JKS keystore alias with multiple key aliases using the
/admin/keystore API causes the error
[ISS.0139.9071] Error: cannot load the keystore pointed to by keystore alias.

When you invoke the /admin/keystore API to create a JKS keystore alias with
multiple key aliases, Integration Server creates the keystore alias but with the
error. 

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-3264 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Integration Server returns details from an internal file without requiring
authentication. 

A call to <host>:<port>/assets/version.properties returns internal details from
the version.properties file without requiring authentication. 

This issue is resolved. Now, accessing the file requires administrator
credentials. 

DTS-3302 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix2)
Integration Server Administrator uses a date/time calendar component from a
third-party library that is no longer maintained. 

Prior to this fix, Integration Server Administrator used the
bootstrap-daterangepicker library for selecting dates. However, this library is
no longer maintained which creates a security risk. 

Integration Sever Administrator now use the ngx-daterangepicker-material
library. 

This resolves the following security vulnerability: CVE 2022-31129

This fix also removes the third-party moment-duration-format library which is no
longer maintained. 

PIE-95921 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix2)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-87732, the number of running services
displayed on the Dashboard includes SOAP services that executed to completion. 

Now, Integration Server properly decrements the number of running services for
SOAP services. 

DTS-3131 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix1)
When killing a session in using the Dashboard > Usages > Current Sessions page 
in Integration Server Administrator, the session ID was exposed in the URL of 
the call to Integration Server.

To make the request for a killing a session more secure, Integration Server 
includes the session ID in the body of the request and not the URL.

DTS-3149 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix1)
When hovering the cursor over a long server log entry in Integration Server 
Administrator, tooltip text appears outside of the tooltip text frame boundary.

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-3226 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix1)
Integration Server Administrator displays a message about a missing WmGRPC 
package even though the package is not installed and is not required.

The WmGRPC package provides support for using gRPC with Integration Server. The 
package is not required. However, when the WmGRPC package is not installed, 
Integration Server Administrator displays the following message:

 [ISS.0030.0013E] (tid=<threadID>) An exception was encountered while processing 
 an administrative request. See the error log for details: Unknown package WmGRPC

This issue is now resolved.

DTS-3228 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix1)
The Current sessions dialog displayed the incorrect value for Connect time.

The Current sessions dialog displayed a Connect time value that divided the 
connect time, which is received as seconds, by 1000. As the connect time is 
received in seconds, not milliseconds, this division was not necessary.

This issue is resolved.

Note: In the Dashboard > Usages tab, the Current sessions dialog can be accessed 
via the Sessions summary table by clicking the number in the Current column for 
the Total sessions row.

DTS-3238 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix1)
Resolution for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in /ssologout endpoint.

The /ssologout endpoint is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing 
malicious actors to inject JavaScript code via the redirectURL query parameter 
into a web page.

This vulnerability is fixed and the redirectURL is sanitized.

PIE-94652 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix1)
Integration Server (IS) exposes the internal IS version details without 
authentication.

Integration Server exposes the internal IS version details maintained in the 
version.properties file without authentication through 
host:port/assets/version.properties.

This issue is resolved. Now, the file requires administrator credentials for 
access.

PIE-98193 (IS_11.1_WmAdmin_Fix1)
Changes to the webMethods Cloud menu in Integration Server Administrator to 
support registering an on-premises Integration Server with the hybrid control 
plane. 

The webMethods Cloud menu now has a Runtime control page to complete registration 
of the on-premises Integration Server with the control plane in IBM webMethods 
Hybrid Integration. The process of registering an on-premises Integration Server 
with the control plane is initiated from the hybrid control plane and continues 
on the webMethods Cloud > Runtime control page. 

The ability to register and manage an on-premises Integration Server with the 
hybrid control plane requires an entitlement to IBM webMethods Hybrid Integration.
