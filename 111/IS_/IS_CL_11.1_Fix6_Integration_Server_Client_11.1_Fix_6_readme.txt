7.0 Fix Contents

PIE-100052
Integration Server throws a FetchError during high-volume tests, causing some
workflows to fail in webMethods Integration.

When Integration Server receives a large number of concurrent requests that
involve retrieving the passman instance of a package, the server validates the
package by accessing the file system. Under heavy load, accessing the file
system disrupts the normal response flow, resulting in an error.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-100313
Changes to possible values for security settings in a streaming connection
alias. 

To clarify the Security Protocol options for a streaming connection alias, the
Security Protocol field has the following changed or additional values: 

- The None option is now PLAINTEXT which indicates that the connection is
unsecured. 

- A blank entry is added to indicate that the connection uses the security set
by the security.protocol key in the Configuration Parameters field. 

PIE-100662
Integration Server now creates a projectmapping.yml file in the
<projectPackage>/config/scaffolding folder to map project assets to runtime
environments for deployment. This file maps assets such as Deploy Anywhere Flow
Services, flow services, workflows, and REST APIs, including individual workflow
steps to specific runtimes for deployment. Integration Server updates the file
whenever you add, modify, or remove an asset throughout the project lifecycle. 

PIE-100664
The metering server URL is updated in webMethods Integration Server for testing 
purpose.

PIE-88551
The webMethods messaging triggers fail with the following error during document
processing:

“[ISS.0153.0041E] webMethods Messaging Trigger <Trigger_name> failed
preprocessing: java.lang.NullPointerException”

When a webMethods messaging trigger receives a document without an attached
envelope for document processing, Integration Server throws NullPointerException
because of the missing envelope. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-95428
JMS trigger in Integration Server intermittently fails with
ClassNotFoundException. 

Integration Server throws ClassNotFoundException while processing JMS
triggers services when the trigger service uses classes from the WmSAP package.
The issue occurs intermittently.

This issue is addressed by introducing a new server configuration parameter,
watt.server.threadPool.releasePkgThread. Set the parameter value to true to
resolve the issue. 

watt.server.threadPool.releasePkgThread
Specifies whether Integration Server should release threads associated with
package-specific classloaders and instead allocate threads linked to
server-level classloaders for handling JMS triggers. When set to true,
Integration Server releases all threads, which are tied to specific package
classes and ensures that only server-level classloaders are used for these
threads. When set to false, Integration Server proceeds with the allocation as
usual without making any changes.The default value is false. 
If you change the setting of this parameter, you must restart Integration Server
for the changes to take effect. 

PIE-95887
Users can create and manage configurations with secrets even if the
vault server configured for Integration Server is unavailable. 

The issue is resolved now.

PIE-96493
Integration Server throws a NullPointerException when invoking the
pub.schema:createXSD service to generate an XML schema from a document type.
 
When Designer extracts an XSD file from a schema document, an internal failure
in the schema processing causes the service to fail with a NullPointerException.
 
This issue is now resolved.

PIE-96500
Integration Server experiences high CPU usage when Universal Messaging servers
are stopped in the Horizontal Scaling setup.

The high CPU usage is due to numerous Universal Messaging client sessions 
repeatedly attempting to reconnect to the stopped servers every 2 seconds.

This issue is resolved by distributing UM session re-connections over a period 
of time to prevent CPU spikes, using two newly introduced server configuration 
parameters:

    - watt.server.messaging.um.session.reconnectImmediately: Specifies whether 
      Integration Server reconnects immediately. Set the parameter to true for 
	  an immediate reconnection attempt or false to prevent the attempt. The 
	  default value is true.
    - watt.server.messaging.um.session.reconnectInterval: Specifies the interval 
	  at which Integration Server attempts an immediate reconnection. The 
      default value is 5 seconds. There is no maximum value for this parameter. 
	  The reconnection interval is calculated as the set value plus a random 
	  value between 0 and the set value.
      For example, if there are 10 sessions, session 1 may have an interval of 5 
      seconds, session 2 may have 7 seconds, session 3 may have 9 seconds, and 
      so on. This staggered retry mechanism prevents all sessions from reconnecting 
      simultaneously, reducing CPU load.

You must restart Integration Server for changes to these parameters to take
effect. 

PIE-96759
Integration Server and Designer exhibit slow response time during design-time
activities for Web Service Descriptors (WSDs).

When working with WSDs generated from large WSDL files, deleting the root folder
or related assets containing numerous elements, such as flow services and
document types, causes Integration Server and Designer to respond slowly.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-96763
The OpenAPI-based POST requests fail with a 403 Forbidden error.

In OpenAPI-based POST requests, Integration Server encodes custom header values,
such as X-CSRF-TOKEN, causing a 403 Forbidden error.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-96780
Integration Server now supports denying access to Integration Server 
Administrator and APIs that are accessed through admin ports. An admin port is
any predefined or custom port associated with the WmRoot or WmAdmin package.
Predefined ports include DefaultPrimary, DefaultDiagnostic, and DefaultSecure.

Use either the watt.server.ports.admin.restrictAccess server configuration
parameter or the WM_PORTS_ADMIN_RESTRICTACCESS environment variable to restrict
access to admin ports.

For more information, see the topics
"Denying access to Integration Server Administrator and APIs", "watt.server.",
and "Environment Variables" in webMethods Integration Server Administrator’s 
Guide.

PIE-97971
Integration Server omits response body due to mismatch between the response 
media type and the OpenAPI definition.

In OpenAPI specification, response schemas are defined per status code and media 
type. If the response media type includes wildcards or parameters
(application/json; charset=utf-8), the server may not return the body. The body
is returned only when the media type exactly matches the OpenAPI definition.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-98119
Optimization to improve service invocation time.

When the server thread pool has a high number of threads and Integration Server
is under heavy load, service invocation might take longer because Integration
Server takes longer to determine which content handler to use. 

Integration Server now uses a different process to determine the content
handler. The revised process may be more performant under heavy load. 

To ensure backward compatibility, Integration Server includes the server
configuration parameter watt.server.content.lockOptimizationEnabled to revert to
the previous behavior. Set this parameter to true to use the new process to
determine the content handler. Set this parameter to false to use the previous
process for determining the content handler. The default value is true. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to take effect. 

PIE-98170
Integration Server restricts the value of
watt.server.http.Content-Security-Policy to script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline',
which limits administrators from using other valid Content-Security-Policy
values.

This issue is now resolved by updating the behavior of the parameter. The
parameter now accepts any valid Content-Security-Policy value.

Note: The Integration Server Administrator includes pages that are built by
using different technologies. Some pages display correctly only with
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'. If you use a different value and the pages
do not work as expected, you can reset the parameter.
For more information about watt.server.http.Content-Security-Policy, see IBM
webMethods Integration Server Administrator's Guide.

PIE-98287
Integration Server does not include HTTP security headers in responses to
requests made through the Integration Server Administrator.

Every HTTP request that the Integration Server Administrator sends must receive
a response with security headers, but several responses do not include them,
even when the headers are configured using the applicable server configuration
parameters. The affected headers are:
X-Content-Type-Options (configured by using watt.server.http.X-Content-Type-
Options)
X-XSS-Protection (configured by using watt.server.http.X-XSS-Protection)
Strict-Transport-Security (configured by using watt.server.http.Strict-
Transport-Security)
Content-Security-Policy (configured by using watt.server.http.Content-Security
-Policy)
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies (configured by using watt.server.http.X-
Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies)

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-98290
Enhancements to statistics data collection.  
 
Integration Server introduces the following changes to provide more control of
collection of purging and data by the Statistics Data Collector. 
 
- A configuration parameter to disable persistence of time-series data. 
The Statistics Data Collector can be configured to capture data statistics for
time-series data but not save that data to a database. A call to the /metrics
endpoint returns time-series data for the current time period. However, the
Dashboard does not display time-series data for the JVM metrics, Usages,
Services, or APIs tabs. 
Use the watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.includeTimeSeriesData server
configuration parameter to control whether the Statistics Data Collector
persists time-series data. Set
watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.includeTimeSeriesData to true to collect and
persist time-series data. Set the parameter to false to collect but not time
persist time-series data. Integration Server does not need to be restarted for
changes to this parameter to take effect. The default value is true. 
 
- A configuration parameter to control the frequency with which the Statistics
Data Collector deletes old data. 
The Statistics Data Collector deletes old data in batches using a scheduled
system task that runs every 4 hours. (Note this is a JVM system task, not an
Integration Server system task).  For every scheduled delete task, Statistics
Data Collector deletes the batches of data collected over a 4 hour period
starting with the oldest data. The delete task performs batch deletions every 30
seconds until all data older than the retention date is removed. The retention
date is controlled by the retentionDays parameter. Prior to this fix, the
frequency of the system task could not be changed. Now, Integration Server
includes server configuration parameters to control the frequency with which the
Statistics Data Collector purges data and the amount of data purged in each
deletion. 
 
watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.removal.interval specifies the number of
hours between each purge of data by the Statistics Data Collector. Set this
parameter to a value greater than or equal to 0. The default is 4 hours. If the
parameter is set to 0, the Statistics Data Collector does not manage the removal
of data. The user must manage deletion of statistics data. 

Integration Server must be restarted for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 
 
Note: The watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.includeTimeSeriesData value does
not impact whether the Statistics Data Collector deletes old data. If you
disable persistence of time-series data, the Statics Data Collector still
removes stale data with a JVM system task. This behavior allows the purge to run
without collecting any additional data. 
 
watt.server.statisticsDataCollector.removal.rows specifies a time interval that
determines the number of rows that each purge removes from the database. To
reduce pressure on the database server, the Statistics Data Collector removes
stale data for the specified segment of time. For example, a value of 15m
indicates that each deleted batch encompasses data collected in a 15 minute time
period. Specify 1 to 3 integers followed by the letters h, H, m, M to indicate
whether the unit of time is in minutes or hours. The default is 4 hours. If you
do not include a unit of time, the Statistics Data Colector ignore the provided
value and uses the default of 4 hours. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
- An internal service to provide more information about the Statistics Data
Collector, including values of server configuration parameters.  Use the
following URL to obtain status information:
<http://host:port>/invoke/wm.server.datacollector:status 
 
PIE-98292
The pub.xslt.Transformations:transformSerialXML service writes the output to 
arbitrary files.

This issue occurs because the service does not verify the fileAccessControl.cnf
file before writing the XSLT transformation results to the file specified in the
outFileName parameter.

This issue is resolved. The service now checks the fileAccessControl.cnf file
to ensure that the file specified in the outFileName parameter is valid and
writable. 

PIE-98564
Changes to Integration Server Administrator API endpoints for working with vault
configuration defined in a package. 

The following Integration Server Administrator API endpoints now support a URL
parameter named PACKAGE for limiting the scope of the operation to a package: 

- GET /admin/vault/connection
- GET /admin/vault/connection/{aliasName}
- GET /admin/vault/connection/{aliasName}/ping
- POST /admin/vault/connection
- PUT /admin/vault/connection
- PATCH /admin/vault/connection/{alias}?action=(enable\|disable\|setPrimary)
- DELETE /admin/vault/connection/{alias}
- GET /admin/vault/{alias}?secretKey={secretKeyName}
- POST /admin/vault/{alias}/upsertSecret
- POST /admin/vault/{alias}?action=(encrypt\|decrypt)
- PATCH /admin/vault/{alias}?action=refreshCache
- PATCH /admin/vault/{alias}/{secretKey}
- DELETE /admin/vault/{alias}
- DELETE /admin/vault/{alias}/secret/{secretKey}

If you do not specify the PACKAGE parameter, the operation applies to vault
connection aliases defined for the server.

Infrastructure change to remove unused staging file for webMethods Integration
(SaaS). 

PIE-98917
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in
pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service. 
 
The resourceUri input parameter for the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service
points to the resource that the client application wants to access on the
resource server. The service accepts any URI which results in Integration Server
attempting to access the URI. This is an SSRF vulnerability 
 
To resolve this vulnerability, Integration Server now uses an allow list with
the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service. If the URI does not appear in the
allow list, the service ends with a ServiceException. 
 
Integration Server introduces two server configuration parameters for enabling
and specifying the allow list for pub.client.oauth:executeRequest. 
 
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled
Specifies whether Integration Server uses an allow list with the
pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service. Set this parameter to true to use the
allow list defined by the watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers parameter.
Set this parameter false if you do not want to use an allow list. A value of
false leaves the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service vulnerable to a
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).  The default value is true. 
 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 
 
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers
Specifies the URIs that can be accessed by the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest
service. When an allow list is used with the service, the value of the
resourceUri input parameter must appear in the list for Integration Server to
attempt to access the URI. If the URI is not in the allow list, the service ends
with a ServiceException that states “<resourceName> resource cannot be accessed.
The resource is not on the allow list.” 

The watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled must be set to true for the allow list
to be enforced. 
 
Integration Server does not need to be restarted for changes to this parameter
to take effect. 

You can set this parameter to a comma- or space-separated list of URIs or the
absolute path to a file. You cannot specify a combination of these. 

To define this parameter using a comma- or space- separated list of URIs, enter
protocol://hostname or protocol://hostname:portnumber. You can specify the IP
address or the name of the machine for hostname. The values are case-sensitive.
Use a space or comma delimiter to specify multiple values. 

To define this parameter using a text file set the value to:
file:pathToFile\filename

For example:
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers=file:c:\oauth\allowedUriList.txt 

The file must use the same syntax as is required for the
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers with the difference that each line
must be an allowed URI or a regular expression. 

Note: The IP address and host name cannot be used interchangeably. For example,
if you specify a host name, and the resourceUri uses the corresponding IP
address, the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service ends with an error. 

You can use an asterisk (*) to indicate that any URI is allowed.

You can also use regular expressions in the comma-separated list of allowed URIs
which can make the list of URIs easier to maintain. Integration Server treats
any value in the comma-separated list that begins with "r:" as a regular
expression. Integration Server treats any value that does not begin with "r:" as
a simple string. The server configuration parameter uses the Java regular
expression syntax, as documented at Pattern (Java Platform SE 7 ) . 

A regular expression value must match the entire value of the supplied
resourceUri value for it to be considered a match. 

Example:

watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers=http://test1.domain.com,r:https?://.*.test2.domain.com:[0-9]+,r:.+\.[a-zA-Z]*-int.domain.com

Integration Server treats the first value, http://test1.domain.com, as a simple
string. If a resourceUri is set to this value, the
pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service attempts to access the URI. 

The second value, "r:https?://.*.test2.domain.com:[0-9]+", contains a regular
expression. The "r:" is not part of the regular expression. The actual regular
expression used to match the supplied resourceUri is
"https?://.*.test2.domain.com:[0-9]+". 

The third value, "r:.+\.[a-zA-Z]*-int.domain.com", contains a regular
expression. The "r:" is not part of the regular expression. The actual regular
expression used to match the supplied resourceUri is
".+\.[a-zA-Z]*-int.domain.com". 

resourceUri: http://test1.domain.com will be accessed because it is equal to the
first value. 
resourceUri: http://my.test2.domain.com:8080 will be accessed because it matches
the second value. 
resourceUri: https://my.test2.domain.com:8088 will be accessed because it
matches the second value. 
resourceURI: http://my.test2.domain.com will not be accessed. If it had a port
number, it would match the second value. 
resourceUri: nbps://example.prod-int.domain.com will be accessed because it
matches the third value. 
resourceUri: example.qa.staging-int.domain.com" will be accessed because it
matches the third value. 
resourceUri: example.dev1-int.domain.com" will not be accessed. If the second
token of the host name did not include any digits, it would have matched the
third value. 

Regular expressions that match any host name, IP address and port (e.g. "r:.+"
and "r:.*") will have the same effect as "*". 

Note: When an allow list is enabled for pub.client.oauth:executeRequest,
Integration Server evaluates the list of regular expressions in
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers sequentially for every request.
Integration Server performs a regular expression match operation on each regular
expression until a match is found or all regular expressions in the list have
been evaluated. Place the more frequently matched regular expressions at the
beginning of the comma-separated list. 

Note: If the watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled parameter is set to true and
you do not specify a value for watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers, all
calls to pub.client.oauth:executeRequest end with an error. 

Important!  If your solution uses the pub.client.oauth:executeRequest service,
after applying a fix that includes PIE-98917 you must take one of the following
actions: 
- Disable the use of an allow list with pub.client.oauth:executeRequest by
setting watt.client.oauth.allowlist.enabled to false. 
- Specify a list of allowed URIs in the
watt.client.oauth.allowlist.allowedServers parameter. 

PIE-99219
Support for using private key JWT client authentication with Microsoft Entra ID
which requires the x5t field in the JWT header. 

When the OpenID token_auth_method is private_key_jwt, Integration Server creates
a JWT (JSON Web Token) to authenticate with the OpenID provider. An additional
requirement with some OpenID providers, such as Microsoft Entra ID, is to
include the x5t field in the JWT header. The x5t field contains the SHA-1
fingerprint of the public key that the OpenID provider uses to verify the
signature of the JWT. This public key corresponds to the private key that
Integration Server uses to sign the JWT. 

To support the additional requirement of the x5t header field, the following
four fields must be populated in the OpenID configuration file for any OpenID
provider that wants the x5t field to be in the JWT header: 

private_key_jwt_keystore_alias - The keystore that contains the private key used
to sign the JWT. 
private_key_jwt_key_alias - The key used to sign the JWT.
private_key_jwt_truststore_alias – The truststore that contains the public key
that corresponds to the key in private_key_jwt_key_alias. 
private_key_jwt_truststore_key_alias - The public key that corresponds to the
private_key_jwt_key_alias. Integration Server uses the public key to generate
the value of the x5t header in the JWT sent to the OpenID provider. 

When sending a token request to the OpenID provider,  Integration Server uses
the private_key_jwt_keystore_alias and private_key_jwt_key_alias values to sign
the JWT. Integration Server uses the private_key_jwt_truststore_alias and
private_key_jwt_truststore_key_alias values to generate the value of the x5t
header field in the JWT. 

Note: The private_key_jwt_keystore_alias and private_key_jwt_key_alias are
required for private_key_jwt authentication with any OpenID provider. 

PIE-99289
The package name is not part of the manifest.v3 file for a package. 

Now, Integration Server adds a name element to the package manifest when the
package is created. 

PIE-99320

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-99519
When using develop once, deploy anywhere, package provisioning did not work
because Git credentials could not be resolved. 

This issue is now fixed.

PIE-99563
When Integration Server is configured to write server log messages at the TRACE
level, the server log does not mask data from the Authorization header. 

If a request uses an authorization scheme beside Bearer or Basic and Integration
Server is configured to write log messages at the TRACE level, the server log
includes the raw bytes of the Authorization header. This poses a security
vulnerability. 

Now, Integration Server masks the contents of the Authorization header in log
messages. 

PIE-99592
The Eclipse JGit library included with Integration Server has been upgraded.

For Integration Server 11.1 the JGit library has been upgraded to version 7.3.0
from version 6.7.0. 
For Integration Server 10.15, the JGit library has been upgraded to version
6.10.1 from version 6.7.0. 

Upgrading the JGit library resolves the following security vulnerability:
CVE-2025-4949. 

PIE-99599
The log4j-* jar files included with Integration Server have been updated to

PIE-99601
Integration Server returns header parameter values and omits body parameters
for a REST API POST request.

In REST API POST requests, Integration Server gives precedence to header
parameters over body parameters when both contain the same names. Therefore,
Integration Server includes only the header values in the response and
ignores the corresponding body parameters.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-99687
Creating a JKS keystore alias with multiple key aliases using the
/admin/keystore API causes the error
[ISS.0139.9071] Error: cannot load the keystore pointed to by keystore alias.

When you invoke the /admin/keystore API to create a JKS keystore alias with
multiple key aliases, Integration Server creates the keystore alias but with the
error. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-99717
PATCH requests lose their request bodies when redirected with 307 or 308
responses. 

Integration Server does not preserve request bodies for the PATCH method during
307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) responses. As a result, it
sends redirected requests without the original payload, leading to incomplete or
invalid updates on the target endpoint. This behavior causes integration failures,
data inconsistencies, and unexpected errors—particularly in environments with
frequent redirects where the redirected endpoint depends on the PATCH request
body. 

This issue is now resolved. Redirect handling is enhanced to ensure that
PATCH requests retain and forward their original request body when the HTTP
client request includes a valid the Location header, the followRedirect
parameter is enabled, and the response status code is 307 or 308. This ensures 
reliable and standards-compliant redirect behavior.

PIE-88183 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
Integration Server throws an error while loading the auto-generated flow
service, genericFault_Response.

When you update a consumer web service descriptor (WSD) from a WSDL
without a response to a WSDL with a response, the genericFault_Response service
creates a Flow.xml file with an invalid XML structure. As a result, Integration
Server throws the following error whenever the server restarts or reloads
the package:
"com.wm.lang.xml.WMDocumentException: [ISC.0042.9327] Expecting

Output variable to an empty document array while using the
pub.list:appendToDocumentList service, Integration Server throws
java.lang.StackOverflowError. As a result, the IBM webMethods Integration UI
becomes unresponsive.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-93828 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
New option to prevent using credentials for a confidential OAuth client to
execute services. 
 
When registering an OAuth client of type confidential, Integration Server
creates a user account and shares a client secret for the account with the
administrator who registered the client. The client secret and client ID are the
credentials the confidential client needs to complete activities such as
requesting an access token and refreshing an access token. However, by default,
Integration Server does not restrict the client from using the credentials to
invoke other services. 
 
Integration Server now provides a server configuration parameter that you can
use to restrict the use of client ID and client secret to services handling
OAuth requests only. 
 
watt.server.oauth.restrictCredentials
Specifies whether Integration Server restricts the use of credentials for a
confidential OAuth client to services that handle OAuth requests only. When set
to false, the client ID and client secret for a registered confidential client
can be used to invoke any service on Integration Server. When set to true,
attempts to use the credentials for a confidential client to invoke a service
that does not handle OAuth processing results in a rejection of the request. The
default is false. 
 
You do not need to restart Integration server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-93947 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)

PIE-94184 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
Single sign-on to Integration Server Administrator using SAML.

Integration Server now provides single sign-on (SSO) for Integration Server
Administrator using SAML 2.0. 
In the SAML single sign-on process, Integration Server acts as the service
provider and sends a SAML request 
to the Identity Provider (IdP). The IdP authenticates the user and sends a SAML
response to Integration Server. 
Integration Server validates the signature of the SAML response and then logs
identified user into Integration Server Administrator. 

After applying this fix, you must complete the following tasks to configure
SAML-based SSO for Integration Server Administrator: 

Complete the following prerequisites:

- Configure an identity provider (IdP) for use with Integration Server.
Activities include 
creating a profile for Integration Server in the IdP and creating a client ID
for the profile. 

- Work with the IdP administrator to configure signing and encryption keys for
the SAML response. 

To configure SAML-based SSO for Integration Server Administrator: 

1. Create a new configuration file named samlsso.cnf with the entries provided
in the 
section “samlsso.cnf configuration file”, below. 

Replace the sample values with values specific to your environment.  

2. Save the samlsso.cnf file in the following location:

<webm_install_dir>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instance-name>/config/security/saml

3 Restart Integration Server.

4. Using Integration Server Administrator, define a trusted SAML issuer for the
IdP. 
Navigate to the Security > SAML page and click Add SAML Token Issuer.
Supply the following information:   

- Issuer Name: the idpURL value in the samlsso.cnf configuration file.

- Truststore Alias: Alias to the truststore that contains the public keys of the
SAML token issuer.

- Certificate Alias: The alias within the truststore that contains the public
key 
of the SAML token issuer. Integration Server uses this certificate associated
with 
this key to verify the signature of the SAML Response returned by the IdP.


samlsso.cnf configuration file
The samlsso.cnf configuration file contains the configuration that Integration
Server needs to 
send SAML requests and handle SAML assertions in responses. The samlsso.cnf file
must contain the following entries with the 
sample value replaced by values specific to your environment:

samlsso.enabled=true
samlsso.idpUrl=http://idpHost:8080/realms/samlsso/protocol/saml
samlsso.acsUrl=http://IShost:5555/WmAdmin?samlsso=true
samlsso.issuerId=http://IShost:5555/WmAdmin?samlsso=true
samlsso.signRequest=true
samlsso.keystoreAlias=is_keystore
samlsso.signatureKeyAlias=keycloak
samlsso.groupAttribute=Groups
samlsso.groupMappings.1.from=admins
samlsso.groupMappings.1.to=Administrators,Developers,ReadOnlyAdministrators
samlsso.groupMappings.2.from=everyone
samlsso.groupMappings.2.to=Everybody

enabled - true|false. Whether SAML-based SSO is in use for this Integration
Server. 
          Must be set to true for SAML-based SSO to work. 

idpURL - URL to which Integration Server sends the SAML request for
authentication. 

acsURL - URL of the assertion consumer, which is Integration Server.
The identity provider (IdP) redirects to this URL with the SAML response. 
Replace ISHost with the host name or IP addresses of Integration Server. 
         Replace 5555 with a secure port on Integration Server. 

issuerId - Client ID of the profile defined for Integration Server in the IdP. 

signRequest - true|false. Whether to sign the SAML request that Integration
Server sends to the IdP. 
              Set to true if the IdP accepts signed SAML requests. 

keystoreAlias - Integration Server keystore alias that contains the certificates
for signing 
SAML requests and decrypting the SAML response returned from the IdP. 

signatureKeyAlias - Key alias for the certificate to use for signing the SAML
request. 

groupAttribute - Name of the IdP attribute that contains the group membership of
the user. 
Integration Server scans the SAML assertion and looks for a SAML Attribute 
		 by this name. Integration Server uses the values for performing mappings from
		 IdP groups to Integration Server groups. 

groupMappings - An array to map IdP groups to Integration Server groups.
For example, the first one shows that, if the value of groupAttribute contains
"admins", 
		it is mapped to the Integration Server group named Administrators, Developers,
		and ReadOnlyAdministrators. Because the Administrators group is part of
Administrators ACL, this user will be able to log into Integration Server
Administrator. 


For each IdP group that needs to be mapped to one or more groups in Integration
Server, create a pair of group mapping entries that start with the format
samlsso.groupMappings.# where # is a number. One member of the pair must include
“from” in the entry name and the other member must include “to”. For example: 

samlsso.groupMappings.1.from
samlsso.groupMappings.1.to

Use the samlsso.groupMappings.#.from entry to specify the IdP group that you to
map to the Integration Server user groups in the samlsso.groupMappings.#.to
entry. 

For example, the entries below establish group mapping 1 in which a user that
belongs to the IdP group named admins will be a member of the Integration Server
groups Administrators, Developers and ReadOnlyAdministrators. 

samlsso.groupMappings.1.from=admins
samlsso.groupMappings.1.to=Administrators,Developers,ReadOnlyAdministrators

The entries below establish group mapping 2 in which a user that belongs to IdP
group "everyone" will be a member of the "Everybody" user group in Integration
Server.. 

samlsso.groupMappings.2.from=everyone
samlsso.groupMappings.2.to=Everybody

For SAML-based SSO for Integration Server Administrator to work, Administrators
must be one of the groups listed for “to”. 
The membership of the user in the Integration Server user group is temporary and
does not persist across server restarts. 

When processing the SAML-based SSO assertion, Integration Server first checks to
see if the user 
identified in the NameID of the SAML assertion exists on Integration Server.
Integration Server searches users defined locally and then users defined
external (LDAP or Central Users). 
If the user exists, Integration Server ignores the groupAttribute and
groupMappings entries. 
If the user does not exist, Integration Server creates a temporary user with a
name that matches 
the NameID from the assertion. Integration Server then extracts the
groupAttribute value to map 
the user to groups as defined in the groupMappings entry in the configuration
file. 

Temporary users remain in Integration Server memory until Integration Server
shuts down. 

After configuring SSO, a user can log into Integration Server Administrator by
clicking “Log in with single sign on” on the https://<host>:<port> login page.

PIE-95103 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
Support for using environment variables or a new custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file to
add classes or libraries to the beginning or end of the Microservices Runtime
classpath instead of modifying setenv.(bat,sh) . 
 
Previously, to add classes or libraries to the beginning or end of the server
classpath for Microservices Runtime, users needed to add the full path in the
Java system properties PREPENDCLASSES or APPENDCLASSES in the <Integration
Server_directory>/bin/setenv.(bat,sh) file. Similarly, users needed to set the
Java system property PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH to add classes or libraries to the
beginning of the Java classpath and set APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH to add classes
or libraries to the end of the Java classpath. Further, the setenv.(bat,sh) file
can be overwritten as part of applying a fix to Integration Server. As a result,
the configuration requirement to update sentenv.(bat,sh) is inflexible and may
be difficult to maintain in a containerized environment. 
 
To address this issue, Microservices Runtime introduces the following changes
for adding classes and libraries to the server or system classpath: 
• A custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file which supports additions to the classpath
through the PREPENDCLASSES, APPENDCLASSES, PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH,
APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH properties in the file. 
• Environment variables that can be supplied during Microservices Runtime
startup to specify additions to the classpath: ENV_PREPENDCLASSES,
ENV_APPENDCLASSES, ENV_PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH, and
ENV_APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH. 
 
After applying this fix, take the following steps to add classes and libraries
can be added to the server classpath and the Java classpath: 
1. If you previously specified values for one or more of the following
properties in setenv.(bat,sh) file, use a text editor to remove the parameters
from the file: PREPENDCLASSES, APPENDCLASSES, PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH,
APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH 
2. To add classes or libraries to the server or Java classpath using the
custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file, use a text editor to open <Integration
Server_directory>{}/bin/ custom_setenv.(bat,sh) and set one or more of the
following parameters and then save the file: 
PREPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the beginning of the server
classpath for Microservices Runtime 
APPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the end of the server classpath
for Microservices Runtime 
PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the beginning of the
Java classpath for Microservices Runtime 
APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the end of the Java
classpath for Microservices Runtime 
3. To add classes or libraries to the server or Java classpath by supplying
environment variables, set one or more of the following environment variables
when starting Microservice Runtime: 
ENV_PREPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the beginning of the server
classpath for Microservices Runtime 
ENV_APPENDCLASSES - classes or libraries to add to the end of the server
classpath for Microservices Runtime 
ENV_PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the beginning of
the Java classpath for Microservices Runtime 
ENV_APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH - classes or libraries to add to the end of the Java
classpath for Microservices Runtime 

Note: If a value is set for a property in custom_setenv.(bat,sh) and for the
corresponding environment variable, the environment variable takes precedence. 

Important! After applying a fix that includes PIE-95103 and moving
PREPENDCLASSES, APPENDCLASSES, PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH, APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH
from setenv.(bat,sh) to custom_setenv.(bat,sh), do not edit setenv.(bat,sh).

Integration Server creates an additional folder with the name {{INSTALL_AREA}}.

Integration Server creates an extra folder called {{INSTALL_AREA}} inside the
<install_directory>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instance_name>/bin folder.
This issue occurs because INSTALL_AREA is set to {{INSTALL_AREA}} in the
custom_setenv.sh file.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Delete the folder {{INSTALL_AREA}}.
2. Edit the file <install_directory>/IntegrationServer/instances
<instance_name>/bin/custom_setenv.sh.
3. Set the value of INSTALL_AREA to 
<install_directory>/IntegrationServer instances/<instance_name>.
4. Save the file.

Calls to an internal service returns internal information about the server.

When the internal API http://<host>:<port>/invoke/wm.server/connect is called

PIE-95669 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
Ability to set the minimum and maximum amount of Java memory for Microservices
Runtime based on a percentage of the system RAM. 

Microservices Runtime now includes the parameter SET_MIN_MAX_MEM in the
Integration Server_directory/bin/custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file to determine
whether memory is set by the JAVA_MIN_MEM and JAVA_MAX_MEM parameters or as a
percentage of system RAM. Microservices Runtime also now supports using the
SET_MIN_MAX_MEM environment variable as an alternative to editing the
custom_setenv.(bat,sh) file. 
 
When SET_MIN_MAX_MEM is set to true, Microservices Runtime starts with the
minimum and maximum Java memory settings provided in the JAVA_MIN_MEM and
JAVA_MAX_MEM.  This is the default behavior. 

Note: The JAVA_MIN_MEM and JAVA_MAX_MEM values are specified and can be edited
in the Integration Server_directory/bin/setenv.(bat,sh) file. Alternatively,
JAVA_MIN_MEM and JAVA_MAX_MEM can be passed in as environment variables. 

When SET_MIN_MAX_MEM is set to false, Microservices Runtime sets maximum and
minimum Java memory based on a percentage of the system RAM. Set the percentage
by completing one of the following tasks: 

- Uncomment JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS in Integration
Server_directory/bin/custom_setenv.(bat,sh). Then, set values for
InitialRAMPercentage and MaxRAMPercentage in custom_setenv.(bat,sh). 

- Set the JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS environment variable, for example:
JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS="-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=30 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50" 

  
To specify Java memory as a percentage of system RAM, do the following:

1. Shut down Microservices Runtime.

2. Use a text editor to open the following file: Integration
Server_directory/bin/custom_setenv.(bat,sh) 

3. Set the SET_MIN_MAX_MEM parameter to false.

4. Uncomment JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS.

5. In the JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS statement set InitialRAMPercentage and
MaxRAMPercentage values. 

JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS="${JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS} -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=<value1>
-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=<value2>" 

   For example:
JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS="${JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS} -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=30
-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=50” 

6. Save the file and restart Microservices Runtime.

In addition to the above procedure, the SET_MIN_MAX_MEM environment variable can
be supplied with a true or false value to indicate if JAVA_MIN_MEM and
JAVA_MAX_MEM parameters or a percentage of system RAM determine the minimum and
maximum Java memory. If you set the SET_MIN_MAX_MEM environment variable to
false, the JAVA_CUSTOM_OPTS  in custom_setenv.(bat,sh) must be uncommented and
values must be set for InitialRAMPercentage and MaxRAMPercentage. 

PIE-95691 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
Service ends with java.util.ConcurrentModificationException.

When a service completes, Integration Server executes cleanup logic for all of
the resources used by that service. An internal class manages the list of
resources and, upon service completion, a thread iterates through the list and
closes the resources one by one. If another thread accesses the list at the same
time, Integration Server throws a  java.util.ConcurrentModificationException. 

The clean-up logic is now thread-safe, ensuring that only one thread at a time
can access the resource list. 

PIE-95838 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
Option to roll back the pipeline when a TRY step ends with failure.

When a TRY step ends with failure, Integration Server does not roll back the
pipeline to the state that existed immediately prior to TRY step execution.
Instead, the pipeline contains any changes made by the TRY step. Legacy
try-catch behavior built using SEQUENCE steps does result in rollback of the
pipeline if the SEQUENCE step ends with failure. 

To resolve the behavior inconsistency between the TRY steps and the legacy
try-catch behavior provided via SEQEUNCE, Integration Server now includes a
server configuration parameter that can be set to determine if Integration
Server rolls back the pipeline when an error occurs during the TRY step. 

watt.server.flow.tryStep.restorePipelineOnError

Specifies whether Integration Server rolls back the pipeline when an error that
occurs during execution of a TRY step results in failure of the TRY step. When
set to true, if an error occurs within the TRY step that causes the TRY step to
end in failure, Integration Server rolls back the pipeline to the state prior to
TRY step execution. When set to false, Integration Server does not roll back the
pipeline if an error results in failure of the TRY step. The default value is
false. 

Integration Server needs to be restarted for changes to the parameter to take
effect. 

Note: Rollback operations are performed on the ﬁrst level of the pipeline only.
That is, ﬁrst-level variables are restored to their original values before the
step failed, but Integration Server does not roll back changes to any documents
to which the ﬁrst-level variables refer.

consider both the flow timeout and connection timeout and adjust connection
retries accordingly. However, the service fails to adjust the connection timeout
or retries based on the flow timeout, causing inconsistencies. 

This issue is now resolved. Now, the service honors the flow timeout.

port in the URL risks the exposure of sensitive information. 

Integration Server now includes a server configuration parameter to control the
disclosure of the host and port in the URL in the response. 

watt.adminapi.hideHostAndPort 
Specifies whether a response includes the server host and port when a resource
in the Integration Server Administrator API returns the URL for an Integration
Server. Set to true to omit the server host and port from the returned URL.  Set
to false to include the host and port in the returned URL. The default is true.

When sending an authorization request to an Open ID Provider, Integration Sever 
includes acr_values parameter which specifies acr (Authentication Context Class 
Reference) values set in the OpenID JSON configuration file. Integration Server 
sets values for the acr_values request parameter using the following logic:

- If the OpenID configuration file includes the acr_values and 
acr_values_supported parameters, Integration Server validates the contents of 
acr_values against the acr_values_supported. Integration Server adds only the 
acr values that appear in the acr_values_supported to the acr_values parameter 
in the authorization request.

- If the OpenID configuration file includes acr_values only, Integration Server 
adds the acr values to the acr_values parameter in the authorization request.

allowing arbitrary host values and exposing the server to security risks.
 
This issue is now resolved by introducing a new server configuration parameter,
watt.server.security.allowedHostHeaders.
 
watt.server.security.allowedHostHeaders:
Specifies a comma-separated list of valid Host header values that Integration
Server accepts for incoming HTTP requests. When you set the
parameter, Integration Server validates the Host header in incoming requests
and returns an "Invalid Host Header" message if the value is not included in
the list or the Host header is left empty. The parameter also supports the
wildcard character asterisk (*) for pattern matching.
For example, watt.server.security.allowedHostHeaders=*.example.com:5555
allows 123.example.com:5555 and abc.example.com:5555 but rejects 
example.com:5555. If you do not set this parameter, Integration Server 
continues to accept all values without validation.
Note: If you set an incorrect hostname or omit the port of the 
Integration Server instance in the parameter value, you may get locked out of 
Integration Server Administrator with an Invalid Host Header error. To avoid 
getting locked out, always include the hostname and port of the 
Integration Server instance in the parameter. If you get locked out, access 
Integration Server Administrator using the server IP and port, then update the 
parameter with the correct values.

You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect.

Certified container images for Integration Server and Microservices Runtime now
use standard base images. 

Prior to this fix, certified container images for Integration Server and
Microservices Runtime used a customized base image of UBI or Alpine. Now, the
certified container images use the standard base images available for UBI and
Alpine. 

Integration Server images use Red Hat Universal Base Image 9 Minimal
(ubi9-minimal). 

Microservices Runtime images are provided with ubi9-minimal or the standard
Alpine with a musl JDK, such as azul/zulu-openjdk-alpine:17-latest.

PIE-98311 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix5)
The pub.client:http service ignores the configured flow timeout for a POST
request with a large payload using chunked transfer encoding.

When a REST API uses the pub.client:http service to send a large payload in a
POST request in chunks, the configured flow timeout is not honored. This issue
occurs because sending the payload in chunks causes the request to take longer
time to complete. During this process, the flow timeout is not enforced as
expected. Consequently, the request continues beyond the configured limit and
eventually fails with an HTTP 500 error after a significant delay.

This issue is now resolved.

Integration Server now has a default content type for responses.

The watt.server.content.type.default server configuration parameter specifies
the content type to use for HTTP requests that do not specify a Content-Type
header. Integration Server now uses the parameter value as the default content
type for responses as well. 

Integration Server uses the value of watt.server.content.type.default as the
content type for the response when all the following conditions are true: 

- A Content-Type header field is not set in the response header.
- The Accept header field in the request header is empty or the
watt.server.http.useAcceptHeader parameter is set to false. 
- The request does not contain a Content-Type header field.

If Integration Server uses the value of watt.server.content.type.default as the
content type and watt.server.content.type.default is set to the default value
(application/octet-stream), responses will use text/html as the content type.

Integration Server resets the internal port access mode to "Deny by default". 
It also includes default services in the allow list.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-95481 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix4)
Option to include or exclude null values in OpenAPI responses.

After applying a fix that includes PIE-92557, Integration Server handles fields
with null values in a REST response differently. Prior to application of a fix 
that includes PIE-92557, Integration Server omits fields with null values in an 
OpenAPI response instead of returning them explicitly. PIE-92557 changed the 
behavior to always include null fields in the response. However, this resulted in 
unexpected and unwanted behavior in some existing implementations.

To resolve this issue, the existing watt.server.rest.includeNullFieldsInResponse
server configuration parameter now controls whether an OpenAPI response 
includes null values. Set the parameter to true to include empty fields with 
null values in the REST response. Set to false to omit empty fields from 
the REST response.

PIE-95543 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server ignores the timeout property for the Invoke flow step
during an HTTP client call.

When a flow service has an Invoke step to call the pub.client:http service and 
the timeout property is configured for the step, Integration Server ignores the 
timeout period while waiting for the pub.client:http service to complete. This 
issue occurs for the following reasons:
- A regression introduced in the resolution for the defect PIE-65495.
- The server relies on the read timeout instead of the INVOKE timeout when 
  reading the response from pub.client:http, which leads to failure in the case 
  of a slow stream.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-95694 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix4)
Integration Server includes query parameters in the response 
body for REST API POST requests.

When a client sends a REST API POST request to Integration Server with query 
parameters and a request body, Integration Server returns a response to the 
client with the query parameters in the response body. However, the query 
parameters should remain outside the response body.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-95809 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix4)
The solution for PIE-95809 does not work on all operating systems.

PIE-95809 changed the file path for encrypted passwords for package-level global 
variables saved in configPassman.cnf to be a relative path instead of an absolute 
path. However, the relative path does not work on all operating systems because 
the file path separator is not handled properly.

Now, file separators in the relative paths in the configPassman.cnf file for a 
package are handled properly.

PIE-95859 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix4)
Content injection is observed while logging in to Integration Server, which may

PIE-96170 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix4)
Outbound SSL handshake is very slow and Integration Serve appears unresponsive.

When Integration Server is configured to reuse SSL sessions for outbound requests 
(watt.security.ssl.resumeClientSessions=true), thread contention issues cause the 
outbound SSL handshake to be very slow when there are multiple concurrent outbound 
requests.  The thread contention resulted in an increase in threads being blocked 
and Integration Server appeared to be unresponsive.

This fix removes the cause of the thread contention, resulting in performance 
improvements when there are multiple outbound SSL requests.

PIE-96247 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix4)
CATCH step does not catch the RuntimeException thrown by a flow service for the 
"Transformers cannot loop over list elements" error.

If a flow service contains a MAP step in which an incorrectly configured 
transformer causes Integration Server to throw a “Transformers cannot loop over 
list elements error”, Integration Server surfaces the error as a RuntimeException. 
However, Integration Server should indicate that the error is a FlowException as 
this error cannot be caught by a CATCH step. When a FlowException occurs, 
Integration Server terminates the entire flow service immediately. If the 
FlowException occurs in a TRY step, the following CATCH step cannot catch the 
FlowException. This is by design.

Integration Server now clarifies that the “Transformers cannot loop over list 
elements error” is a FlowException wrapped in a RuntimeException.

Prior to this fix, Integration Server produces the following error:

java.lang.RuntimeException: [ISC.0049.9027] Error at 
pub.list:appendToDocumentList - Transformers cannot loop over list elements

After this fix, Integration Server produces the following error to avoid the 
confusion where this error is expected to be caught by the TRY/CATCH steps:

java.lang.RuntimeException: com.wm.lang.flow.FlowException: [ISC.0049.9027] 
Error at pub.list:appendToDocumentList - Transformers cannot loop over list elements

In the pub.string:isNullEmptyOrWhitespace service, the ifPresent boolean input 
parameter is a text field in Designer.

Although Designer displays the ifPresent parameter as a text field,
Integration Server handles the parameter value as boolean. However, the

execution errors.

The issue is resolved. Now, Designer displays the parameter as a drop-down
field with only true or false as options.

The pub.string:lookupTable service makes Integration Server vulnerable
to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.

The pub.string:lookupTable service allows regex-based searches without
validation or timeout, making Integration Server vulnerable to
ReDoS attacks.

This issue is now resolved by adding the regexTimeout input parameter to 
the service.

regexTimeout: Specifies the maximum execution time in milliseconds for regex 
matching. Integration Server supports the Perl5 (Apache ORO) and Java Regex 
engines for regex matching. When regexTimeout is set, Integration Server uses 
Java Regex regardless of the configured regex engine. If not set, the configured 
regex engine (Perl5 or Java Regex) is used. By default, the parameter value is blank.

- Private Key Property Name: jndi.<aliasName>.privateKeyProp 
- Other Properties: jndi.<aliasName>.<otherProp1>=<value1>

Other Properties are properties the JNDI provider requires for JNDI configuration 
that do not correspond to a JNDI provider alias property. For each additional 
property, add  jndi.<aliasName>.<otherProp1>=<value1>  where <otherProp> is the 
property name and <value1> is the property value.

The jcode hailmary command returns the doesCompilationHasError flag as false 
even when package compilation has errors.

When you run the jcode hailmary command, if the compilation result has errors, 
the command returns the doesCompilationHasError flag as true. However, if the 
compilation result has errors and warnings, the doesCompilationHasError 
flag is false. This behaviour is because the jcode logic checks the last line 
of the compilation result to identify errors. When warnings are present, the 
jcode logic incorrectly picks up the warning text instead of the error text.

This issue is now resolved.

The certificate chain is added to the request header when the client certificate 
chain is sent to Integration Server in a mutual SSL/TLS passthrough mode through 
the AWS load balancer. However, Integration Server fails to authenticate the 
certificate chain in the "X-Amzn-Mtls-Clientcert" request header, resulting in

chain added to the "X-Amzn-Mtls-Clientcert" request header.

PIE-93968 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
Changes to Integration Server to limit vulnerability to a path traversal attack.

To limit vulnerabilities to path traversal attacks, Integration Server restricts
file operations to the Integration Server root directory. However, Integration
Server also provides a configuration parameter to specify directories for which
the path traversal check will be bypassed and another parameter to control how
Integration Server responds when a path traversal violation is found. Further,
Integration Server provides a configuration parameter that can be used to
restrict path traversal in custom IS client applications. Detailed information
about these parameters follows. 

watt.security.allowedDirectories
Specifies a comma-separated list of directories for which Integration Server
bypasses the path traversal check. If an operation specifies a directory outside
of the Integration Server root directory and the directory is not listed in
watt.security.allowedDirectories, the action that Integration Server takes
depends on the value of watt.server.file.pathViolation.action. 

There is no default value for this parameter. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for a change to this parameter
to take effect. 

watt.server.file.pathViolation.action
Specifies the action that Integration Server takes when an operation specifies a
path outside of the Integration Server root directory and the path is not
included in watt.security.allowedDirectories. Set to one of the following: 

- none:  Integration Server does not perform path traversal checks.
- warning: Integration Server performs path traversal checks and writes a
Warning to the server log security log when a violation occurs but allows the
operation to proceed. 
- exception: Integration Server performs path traversal checks. When a violation
occurs, Integration Server blocks the operation and raises a SecurityException, 

The default value is warning. 

Integration Server does not need to be restarted for change to this parameter to
take effect. 

watt.client.allowedRootDir
Specifies the root directory for a custom Integration Server client application.
The Integration Server client code restricts file operations to this directory.
This property applies only to client applications. Within Integration Server,
watt.client.allowedRootDir has no effect. There is no default value for this
parameter.

Rebuilding the Apache Lucene document repository used by the Statistics Data
Collector may negatively impact performance. 

When the Apache Lucene document repository used by the Statistics Data Collector
is purged, Integration Server rebuilds by executing an unbounded SQL select of
metrics data. When the number of rows in the database is large, executing the
unbounded query can place a heavy load on the database and negatively impact
performance. 

Now, Integration Serve rebuilds the repository by executing a collection of
bounded batches of SQL rows, which ensure the number of results for each query

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94301 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
Changes to handling of OAuth authorization codes.

Integration Server generates OAuth authorization codes and stores the codes in
cache. After Integration Server issues a bearer token to an OAuth client in
exchange for the authorization code, Integration Server removes the
authorization code from cache. Integration Server executes the Remove Expired
AuthCodes system task to remove unused expired authorization codes from cache.
The watt.server.oauth.authCode.expirySeconds server configuration parameter
determines the frequency with which the system task executes. 

This fix also includes internal changes for supporting OAuth with layered
products.

PIE-94748 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server Administrator allows users to create a JMS connection alias
with script tags and other invalid data. 

In Integration Server Administrator > Messaging > JMS Settings >
Create JMS Connection Alias, users can create an alias with
script tags and invalid data. Integration Server establishes a JMS 
connection using the alias with malicious content, which leads to 
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server validates the data 
entered before saving the alias.

PIE-94810 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
A vulnerable, unused version of org.apache.commons.configuration appears in

Integration Server intermittently fails to parse the input stream when 
constructing a S/MIME message using the pub.mime:createMimeData service because 
of an unknown content type, resulting in the error.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94901 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
Enhancements to improve execution of metrics endpoint.

When the metrics endpoint is invoked, Microservices Runtime (or an Integration
Server with a Microservices license) gathers server, service-level, and JVM
metrics and returns the data in a Prometheus format. At times, Microservices
Runtime might be slow to return results. 

This fix reduces the execution time for the metrics endpoint.

PIE-94985 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
In a horizontal scalability setup, when one Universal Messaging (UM) node goes
down, the Client Side Queue (CSQ) count for the webMethods messaging connection
alias on Integration Server increases. 
 
Consider that Integration Server uses a Universal Messaging 
horizontal scalability URL (for example, (UM1)(UM2)(UM3)) as the Realm URL in
the webMethods Messaging Connection Alias configuration. In this scenario,
instead of routing messages to the remaining UM nodes in the horizontal
scalability setup, the server queues the messages in the CSQ, which increases
the CSQ count. 
 
This issue is resolved by setting the
watt.server.um.producer.transaction.commitRetryCount server configuration 
parameter to a value greater than 0. For more information on the parameter, see 
IBM webMethods Integration Server Administrator's Guide. 

PIE-95071 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
When reviewing a project in webMethods.io, the internal API call for the project

PIE-95103 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
Support for using environment variables to add classes or libraries to the
beginning or end of the Microservices Runtime classpath instead of modifying
setenv.bat/sh. 

Previously, to add classes or libraries to the beginning or end of the
Microservices Runtime classpath, users needed to add the full path in the Java
system properties PREPENDCLASSES or APPENDCLASSES in the <Integration
Server_directory>/bin/setenv.bat(sh) file. Similarly, users needed to set the
Java system property PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH to add classes or libraries to the
classpath before proxy.jar and set APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH to add classes or
libraries to the absolute end of the CLASSPATH. This configuration requirement
is inflexible and may be difficult to maintain in a containerized environment. 

To address this issue, Microservices Runtime now supports the use of the
following environment variables: 

- PREPENDCLASSES adds classes or libraries  to the classpath after the
server.jar 
- APPENDCLASSES adds classes or libraries to the to the end of the CLASSPATH
- PREPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH adds classes or libraries to the classpath before
proxy.jar 
- APPEND_SYSTEM_CLASSPATH adds classes or libraries to the absolute end of the
CLASSPATH 

The values set for environment variables take precedence over values set in
setenv.sh/bat. 

PIE-95341 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
Integration Server fails to log failed audit entries during shutdown.

Integration Server suppresses shutdown exceptions, which prevents errors from
being logged, and the logging process itself causes errors. 

This issue is now resolved. Integration Server now records these exceptions in
the error log.

To resolve this issue, Integration Server uses a new connection from the JDBC
connection pool each time it deletes a batch of data from the IS_MONITOR table. 

PIE-95422 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
After applying a fix that includes PIE-93480, a BRANCH step that performs a

PIE-95577 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)
Creating HTTPS proxy server alias using environment variables.

When starting Integration Server as a Docker container, pass all the following
environment variables at startup to create a proxy server alias for HTTPS:

- WM_HTTPS_PROXY_ALIAS: Specifies the name of the proxy server.
- WM_HTTPS_PROXY_HOST: Specifies the host name or IP address of the proxy
  server.
- WM_HTTPS_PROXY_USER: Specifies the user name Integration Server uses to
  access the proxy server.
- WM_HTTPS_PROXY_PWD: Specifies the password Integration Server uses to
  access the proxy server.
- WM_HTTPS_PROXY_PORT: Specifies the port on which the proxy server listens to
 HTTPS requests.
- WM_HTTPS_PROXY_IS_DEFAULT: Specifies whether the proxy server alias should be
  the default proxy server alias for HTTPS or not. Only one default proxy server
  alias can be set for each protocol type. The values are Yes (Y) or No (N). If 
  no value is provided, this defaults to N.
  
To view the log details of proxy server alias, set Generate Auditing Data on
Startup to Yes in Integration Server Administrator > Logs > Logging configuration
> Security Logger > Edit Security Logger

If you are configuring a default proxy server alias with the same name using an
environment variable and a configuration variable, the environment variable
takes precedence over the configuration variable. However, if a default HTTPS
proxy server alias already exists, you cannot create a new HTTPS alias as
default using an environment variable.

PIE-95580 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix3)

Restriction on overriding default HTTPS proxy alias using environment variables.

If you are configuring a default proxy server alias with the same name using an

PIE-87487 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server throws java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException for some 
certificates used in an Enterprise Gateway configuration.

In an Enterprise Gateway configuration, when the internal Integration Server 
sends a certificate containing tab and newline characters 
(\r\n) to the registration port for authentication, the registration port treats 
"\r\n" as the end of the payload and fails to read the certificate, causing 
Integration Server to throw the exception.

The issue is now resolved by introducing the following server configuration 
parameter:

watt.server.enterprisegateway.cert.delimiter 
Specifies the characters that mark the end of the payload when the internal 
Integration Server sends a certificate to the Enterprise Gateway registration 
port for authentication. If the certificate includes tab and newline characters 
(\r\n), apply the fix with PIE-87487 to both the internal and Enterprise Gateway 
servers and set the parameter value to "$$". The default value is "\r\n".

Note: If you change the value of this property, you must disable and then enable
the Enterprise Gateway external port, Enterprise Gateway registration port, and 
the internal server port for the changes to take effect.

PIE-87951 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server incorrectly treats a Swagger REST request as an OpenAPI REST 
request, resulting in service failures.

When a client invokes a Swagger REST request after an OpenAPI REST request, 
Integration Server incorrectly treats the Swagger REST request as an OpenAPI
REST request. This results in Integration Server placing the wrong data in the 
pipeline, which leads to service failure.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94519 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix2)
Configuration variables does not provide a way to specify the order in which
LDAP directories are searched. 

An Integration Server can be configured to search multiple LDAP directories for
user authentication. The order in which the LDAP directories are listed on the
Security > User management > LDAP configuration page in Integration Server
Administrator determines the order in which Integration Server searches the LDAP
directories for a user. While configuration variables (application.properties)
can be used to define an LDAP directory for an Integration Server, it does not
provide a way to specify the order in which Integration Server searches the LDAP
directories. As a result, Integration Server searches the LDAP server entries in
an arbitrary order. 

To resolve this issue, this fix introduces the configuration variable:
ldap.<uuid>.order. Use this variable to indicate the order in which Integration
Server creates and searches LDAP directories for a matching user during
authentication. Integration Server creates LDAP directories in ascending order,
starting with 1. If two or more LDAP directories are assigned the same order
number, Integration Server creates the LDAP directories with the same number in
an arbitrary order. If an LDAP directory is not assigned an order number,
Integration Server creates the directory after creating directories with an
order number. Integration Server searches the LDAP directories in the same order
in which it creates them. 

PIE-94534
Upgrade of Apache Lucene libraries to version 8.11.3 to remediate a security

PIE-94586 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix2)
In Integration Server 10.15, SFTP login fails when the Integration Server
attempts to reuse an existing SFTP session to connect to the SFTP server.

After migrating from 10.11 to 10.15, running the pub.client.sftp:login service
with reuseSession parameter set to true results in the error:
Cannot invoke "com.sshtools.sftp.SftpClient.cd(String)" because the return value
of "com.wm.app.b2b.server.sftp.client.SFTPSession.getSftpClient()" is
null.

This issue arises when a logged-in user navigates to a directory other than
the home directory. The session retains the current directory information,
which the service mistakenly treats as the default directory for subsequent
logins using the same session. Consequently, Integration Server fails to log
in to the SFTP server.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server introduces the
"watt.server.sftp.resetHomeDir" parameter that determines the user's default
default directory upon login. By default, the parameter is false. Set the
parameter to true to ensure that the user's home directory is always the default
directory upon login.

You need not restart Integration Server for the changes to the parameter
to take effect.

PIE-94635 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix2)
Users can access Integration Server Administrator with an expired password.

PIE-95189 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix2)
Integration Server crashes on startup when watt.server.http.enable is set to
false.

When the watt.server.http.enable server configuration parameter
is set to false, all HTTP ports are disabled, including the primary HTTP port
(5555). This causes Integration Server to crash at startup, as HTTPS port is
considered as the primary listener. Conversely, if by default the watt property
is set to true, all HTTP ports are enabled instead of just the default primary

This issue is now resolved. The server configuration parameter works only
when Integration Server uses a security profile.

PIE-95308 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix2)
Upgrade the Apache commons-io library included in wpm (webMethods Package

PIE-88449 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server prevents users from logging in by trying to authenticate them
through inaccessible LDAP referral servers.

In a distributed LDAP setup, the referral mechanism lets an LDAP server
redirect Integration Server to another server if the requested data is
unavailable. But you can bypass the referral mechanism by
setting the watt.server.ldap.extendedProps server configuration parameter to 
java.naming.referral=ignore. However, Integration Server ignores this setting 
and continues to authenticate users through inaccessible LDAP servers, 
preventing their login attempts.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-88566 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
The pub.xml:queryXMLNode service trims leading and trailing whitespaces
in the query result.

The service must return the content of the queried field in the XML node
without modifications. However, the service trims the spaces around the
field content.

This issue is resolved. Now, Integration Server provides the
watt.client.node.trimBlanks server configuration parameter, which determines
whether the service trims the leading and trailing whitespaces or retains them.
Set the parameter to false to retain and true to trim the white spaces.
The default value for the parameter is true.

You do not need to restart the server for changes to the parameter to take
effect.

ffdata object being added to the pipeline. 
 
After applying a fix or upgrading to a release that includes PIE-84414, when
Integration Server receives a flat file request without a body (payload), a null
ffdata object is not added to the pipeline as it was before. The change for
PIE-84414 resolves an issue where a SocketTimeOutException occurred for requests
that did not have a body and the request specified one of the following
Content-Types: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/xml, and text/xml.
However, this change is not needed for all Content-Types and can cause issues in
existing implementations that relied on the old behavior. 
 
To resolve this issue, Integration Server now includes a server configuration
parameter to process empty payloads for specific Content-Types. 
 
watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload
Specifies a comma-separated list of Content-Types for which Integration Server
processes an empty payload.  When Integration Server receives a request with an
empty payload and the Content-Type header is specified in
watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload, Integration Server processes the
empty payload with the request. For example, if
watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload is set to text/plain, when
Integration Server receives a flat file request with an empty payload,
Integration Server places a null ffdata object in the pipeline of the processing
service. If watt.server.content.type.processEmptyPayload does not specify
text/plain, Integration Server does not add an empty object to the pipeline when
receiving a flat file request with no payload. The default value is text/plain. 
 
Do not set this parameter to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/xml,
and text/xml as it will result in a SocketTimeOutException when Integration
Server receives requests with one of those Content-Types and with empty
payloads. 
 
You do not need to restart Integration Server for changes to this parameter to
take effect. 

PIE-94018 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Changes to Integration Server to address vulnerability to Server-Side Request
Forgery (SSRF) attack. 

Integration Server can now be configured to perform SSRF checking on outbound
server connections. Integration Server provides server configuration parameters
that can be used to enable SSRF checking on direct connections and redirect
connections. 

watt.net.http.connect.performSSRFcheck: Specifies whether SSRF checking is
performed for direct outbound connections. When SSRF checking is performed for
direct outbound connections, Integration Server verifies that the host to which
the request is being sent is on the allow list established by the
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist parameter. If the host is not on the allow list,
Integration Server rejects the request with the error "Connection to URL {0} is
not permitted." Set to true to enable SSRF checking for direct outbound
connections. Set to false to disable SSRF checking for direct outbound
connections. The default is false. A value of true is more secure. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

watt.net.http.redirect.performSSRFcheck: Specifies whether SSRF checking is
performed for redirected outbound connections. When SSRF checking is performed
for redirected outbound connections, Integration Server verifies that the host
to which the request is being redirected is on the allow list established by the
watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist parameter. If the host is not on the allow list,
Integration Server rejects the request with the error "Redirection to URL {url}
is not permitted." Set to true to enable SSRF checking for redirected outbound
requests. Set to false to disable SSRF checking for redirected outbound
requests. The default is false. A value of true is more secure. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

watt.net.http.ssrf.allowlist:  Specifies a comma-delimited list of regex
expressions for allowed host names for SSRF checking. If SSRF checking is
enabled for direct outbound connections and/or redirected outbound connections,
the host name to which the direct or redirected outbound request is being sent
must appear in the allow list established by this parameter. This parameter is
empty by default. 

Integration Server restart is required for changes to this parameter to take
effect. 

PIE-94031 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server allows CRUD operations with a password
in one browser even after the password is reset in another.

If a user is logged in to Integration Server Administrator in two different
browsers, despite changing the password in one of the browsers,
Integration Server allows CRUD operations with the old password from the
other.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94081 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Creating an Integration Server instance using the is_instance.bat script
results in the following message:
Required property 'license.file' is not set. Integration Server instance will
shutdown after 30 minutes.

The license requirement is removed from the product. However, the Dlicense.file
property passed to the script causes the script to look for a license file,
which results in this message.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94104 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Change to prevent NulPointerException caused in IBM webMethods Integration. 

PIE-94117 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server throws NullPointerException during the input 
validation for a flow service.

When running a flow service with the input validation enabled, 
Integration Server throws NullPointerException during the input 
validation because an input parameter references an empty 
document without an assigned value.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94167 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Integration Server fails to create a consumer or provider REST API
Descriptor (RAD) from an OpenAPI document.

When you create a consumer or provider RAD from an OpenAPI 
document, if the document contains two equivalent paths with 
different HTTP methods, Integration Server throws the following error:

Failed to create REST API descriptor. Reason: The OpenAPI document
contains equivalent paths.

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94326 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
When security logging is enabled, Integration Server does not write login
failures that occur using the Integration Server Administrator login page to the
security log. 

This issue is now resolved.

PIE-94358 (IS_11.1_Core_Fix1)
Beginning with IS_10.15_Core_Fix13, the Dockerfile generated by the is_container
script does not create the sagadmin user as the container user. 
 
Prior to IS_10.15_Core_Fix13, when generating a Dockerfile, the is_container
script created a sagadmin user which had ownership of the files in the Docker
image. This was the default behavior. A user who is logged into the container
created using that image can run commands as the sagadmin user. Beginning with
to IS_10.15_Core_Fix13, the script does not create the sagadmin user. The
generated Dockerfile needs to be modified manually to add the command that
creates the user. While the sagadmin user is not needed to run Integration
Server or Microservices Runtime in a Docker container (Docker runs everything as
root), the existence of the sagadmin user is a convenience. 
 
Now, the is_container script once again creates the sagadmin user by default. If
-Dimage.createUser=false, the is_container script does not create the sagadmin
user.
