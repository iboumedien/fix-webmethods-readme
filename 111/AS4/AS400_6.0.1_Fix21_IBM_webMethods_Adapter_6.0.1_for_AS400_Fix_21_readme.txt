WAS-277
Updated copyright notes, vendor, and product names for IBM rebranding.

WAS-242 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix20)
In webMethods Adapter for AS/400, the value that must be passed to the input
state parameter in wm.as400.admin:setResourceState built-in service is case
sensitive and the only values permitted are enabled and disabled. When any value
other than enabled and disabled is passed as the input state parameter to the
wm.as400.admin:setResourceState built-in service, the connection specified and
the listeners associated with the connection specified are deleted.

This issue is now resolved.

WAS-241 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix20)
In webMethods Adapter for AS/400, the signature for wm.as400.access:callProgram
built-in service fails to display the recordMetaData input parameter in Software
AG Designer.

This issue is now resolved.

WAS-214 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix19)
In webMethods Adapter for AS/400, unable to externalize the connection pool
management properties while externalizing the connection.

WAS-162 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix18)
webMethods Adapter for AS/400 now supports SSL connection.

WAS-164 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix17)
In webMethods Adapter for AS/400, if incorrect connection details are specified
in the application.properties file, the connection appears in Enabled state when
Integration Server is started.

This issue is now resolved. 

WAS-118	(AS400_6.0.1_Fix16)
webMethods AS/400 Adapter has been enhanced to support Admin APIs for 
connections and listeners.

WAS-103 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix15)
In webMethdods Adapter for AS400, the Data Queue Listeners does not respond even 
if they are enabled.

This issue is now resolved. A new watt property
"watt.adapter.as400.<listenerAlias>.socketProperties" has been added that allows
you to specify more than one socket properties.

RGHADPESTBL-6012 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix14)
webMethods AS/400 Adapter now supports externalizing the connection
configuration assets. 

WAS-87 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix13)
In webMethods Adapter for AS/400, the connections in the connection pool do not 
expire even after Expire Timeout. 

This issue is now resolved. To expire the connection in the pool, configure the 
Block Timeout to zero.

WAS-72 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix12)
In webMethods AS/400 Adapter, the adapter's administrator UI pages does not 
support the new Administrator screens of Integration Server(IS) 10.1.

This issue is resolved. webMethods AS/400 Adapter now supports the new 
Administrator screens of IS from version 10.1 and later. 

WAS-63 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix11)
In webMethods AS/400 Adapter 6.0.1, an error occurs when running
wm.as400.access:returnConnection service.

If the getConnection and returnConnection services are called in a loop, then 
the returnConnection will fail. The AS400 connection pool sends a connection 
which is already in use, where the used connection is closed by some other AS400 
returnConnection call.

This issue is partially resolved. Adapter now checks if the connection is 
already in use, and asks for the other connection. If the other connection is 
also in use, then the adapter throws an exception.

WAS-71 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix11)
Adapter Fix Install and Uninstall was not Supported for IS 10.0 and 10.1

This issue is resolved. 

WAS-61 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix10)
webMethods AS400 Adapter support for new Admin screens IS 9.10 onwards. 

webMethods AS400 Adapter Admin UI pages did not support new format of screens 
developed for IS 9.10. 

This issue is resolved now by modifying the webMethods AS400 Adapter pages.

WAS-54 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix9)
In webMethods AS/400 Adapter 6.0.1, the adapter does not respond to request in 
clustered Integration Server environment.

In a clustered environment, the adapter does not respond to requests from 
Integration Server due to a Deadlocked Thread in node of the cluster.

This issue is resolved. Now, the adapter responds to requests from Integration 
Server in a clustered environment. 

WAS-47 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix8)
The webMethods AS/400 Adapter wm.as400.access:callProgram service does not 
populate the lastError/error output parameter when the recordMetaData is of 
PackedDecimal type.

When you pass a null value or an empty string to the recordData input parameter 
of the wm.as400.access:callProgram service with a recordMetaData of 
PackedDecimal data type, AS/400 Adapter throws a java.lang.NumberFormatException. 
As a result, the lastError/error output parameter has a null value.

The issue is resolved. Now the adapter service returns an error message in the 
lastError/error output parameter. 

WAS-37 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix7)
When using webMethods AS/400 Adapter, logging for JTOpen can not be disabled.

The tracing behavior of JTOpen (the IBM toolkit for AS400) can not be externally 
configured when using AS/400 Adapter.

The issue is resolved. Now you can configure the logging for JTOpen using the 
new watt property, watt.adapter.as400.trace. By default the 
watt.adapter.as400.trace property is set to false and the trace is disabled.

To enable logging for JTOpen:
1. Start Integration Server and log into
   Integration Server Administrator.
2. From Integration Server Administrator, select
   Settings > Extended > Edit Extended Settings.
3. Enable the trace by setting watt.adapter.as400.trace=true.
  (If the parameter is not shown, add it.)
4. Click Save Changes. Keys for the new parameters
   appear in the Extended Settings list.
5. Restart Integration Server. 

WAS-27 (AS400_6.0.1_Fix5)
The parameter 'recordMetaData' is missing from the input signature of the AS/400 
Adapter service, wm.as400.access:writeDataQ.

According to the webMethods AS/400 Adapter Installation and User's Guide 6.0.1, 
the wm.as400.access:writeDataQ built-in service contains the input parameter 
'recordMetaData'. However, the 'recordMetaData' parameter does not appear in the 
service's input parameters in Developer.

This issue is resolved. The 'recordMetaData' input parameter is now visible in 
Developer.

1-1Z1ANV (AS400_6.0.1_Fix4)
WmAS400 Data Queue Listeners fail to process data from the specified data queue 
when Integration Server is restarted.

The AS/400 Data Queue Listener configuration settings specify the Listener Node 
Integration Server service for a data queue. When there is a new entry to the 
data queue monitored by a Data Queue Listener, the Listener and the specified 
Listener Node service process the new data queue entry.

If an entry is made to the data queue at the time of Integration Server restart, 
the Data Queue Listener starts reading the entries from the data queue as soon 
as the WmAS400 package is loaded, and the start up service, 
wm.as400.admin:startup, is invoked. The Integration Server may not be running at 
this point of time, as a result the Listener Node Integration Server service
is unable to process the data queue entry successfully.

This issue is resolved. The Data Queue Listeners are now started only when the 
Integration Server is running.

1-1Z5IWP (AS400_6.0.1_Fix3)
All connection operations for webMethods AS/400 Adapter 6.0.1 throw an error 
with Integration Server 8.0.

When using the adapter with Integration Server 8.0, all adapter 
connection-related operations fail (create, edit, enable,disable, delete) with 
the following error:Stack Trace: com.wm.app.b2b.server.ServiceException:
com.wm.app.b2b.server.ServiceException: Exception: Error Encoding
String: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Invalid key for PbeWithMD5AndDES_CBC.

This issue is resolved.This error is not thrown for adapter connection 
operations.

1-1YXE7Y (AS400_6.0.1_Fix3)
The recordMetaData parameter is missing from the input signature for some of the 
services in webMethods AS/400 Adapter 6.0.1.

According to the webMethods AS/400 Adapter Installation and User?s Guide, the 
following services require the recordMetaData parameter to be specified in the 
input:wm.as400.access:callProgram and wm.as400.access:dataQEntryToRecord. 
However, the recordMetaData parameter is missing from the input signature of 
these services.

This issue is resolved. The recordMetaData parameter is included in the 
callProgram and dataQEntryToRecord services.

1-1Z1C9X (AS400_6.0.1_Fix3)
The output of the webMethods AS/400 Adapter 6.0.1 service 
wm.as400.access:dataQEntryToRecord contains "keyValue" as type Stringlist 
instead of the documented type String.

The defined output of the dataQEntryToRecord service contains a String field 
named "keyValue". However at run time, this field appears as Stringlist instead 
of a String in the output pipeline.

This issue is resolved. The dataQEntryToRecord service now returns the 
"keyValue" output parameter of type String.

1-1RPYWR (AS400_6.0.1_Fix2)
webMethods AS/400 Adapter connections stop responding whenever the AS/400 server 
is restarted.

When the AS/400 server is restarted, the AS/400 Adapter connections stop 
responding. This behavior occurs because there is a stale connection in the 
connection pool and the adapter is using that connection at restart. Because the 
minimum connection pool size is set to 1, the connection is not reset after
restarting the server. Because there is no way to specify a connection timeout 
value, the connection pool continues to process this stale connection, and stops 
responding.

This issue is resolved. A new watt property
"watt.adapter.as400.<connectionAlias>.socketProperties" has been added. 
This property allows you to specify one or more socket properties.

To use this new watt property, include this property in the Extended Settings 
screen of the IS Administrator, replacing <connectionAlias> with the actual 
connection alias, and then specifying one or more socket properties and their
values. Use a semi-colon separator between multiple socket properties. Specify 
the soTimeout property to specify the socket timeout value that will take effect 
if a connection is hanging on a socket read call, thus avoiding hung connections.

For example, to set the socket timeout to 5 milliseconds for connection alias 
AS400SampleConnection, specify:

watt.adapter.as400.AS400SampleConnection.socketProperties={soTimeout=5}

You can also set more than one property with this watt property. For example, 
to set the keepAlive and receiveBufferSize properties for connection alias  
S400SampleConnection, specify:

watt.adapter.as400.AS400SampleConnection.socketProperties=
{keepAlive=false;receiveBufferSize=3}

For the list of configurable socket properties for AS/400 that you can set with 
this watt property, see:
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iadthelp/v7r0/index.jsp?
topic=/com.ibm.etools.iseries.toolbox.doc/
javadoc/com/ibm/as400/access/SocketProperties.html

Note: You can also edit the
webMethods6\IntegrationServer\config\server.cnf file to include this watt 
property. For more information about working with extended settings, see the 
webMethods Integration Server Administrator's Guide.

1-13XXPX (AS400_6.0.1_Fix1)
wm.as400.access:writeDataQ service is missing inputs after updating the adapter 
to version 6.0.1.

In webMethods AS/400 Adapter 6.0, the wm.as400.access:writeDataQ service 
contains the input parameter RecordMetaData. But after upgrading the adapter to 
version 6.0.1, the RecordMetaData parameter no longer appears in the service's 
input parameters in Developer.

This issue is resolved, and the RecordMetaData input parameter now correctly 
appears.
