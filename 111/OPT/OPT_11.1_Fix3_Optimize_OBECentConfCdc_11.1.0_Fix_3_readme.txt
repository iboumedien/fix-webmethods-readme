 the fix you must back up the Optimize database and your file system.

In IBM webMethods Optimize, email notifications might fail when using SMTP servers with strict security requirements.

The issue is resolved. A new REST-based email sending mechanism has been implemented using Microsoft Graph API as an alternative to traditional SMTP.The system now supports both traditional SMTP (with added TLS support) and Microsoft Graph API (using OAuth authentication).

A new Authentication Type option has been introduced in the mail settings configuration with two choices:

Basic Authentication

Under Basic authentication, the following new properties have been added:

- Mail Server Port: For specifying the port number of your mail server
- TLS Enabled: A checkbox to enable secure TLS connections


REST Authentication

Under REST configuration, you need to configure:

- Default Sender: The email address of the user on behalf of whom your application will send emails
- Client ID: The ID of the application registered in Microsoft Entra
- Client Secret: The secret generated for the application
- Tenant ID: The ID of the tenant in which the application is registered


The application must have Mail.Send permission of Application type granted and access to the mailbox of the configured default sender.
