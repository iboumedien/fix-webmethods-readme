8.0 Installation

1. Shut down all servers. A safe shutdown procedure is as follows.

a. Shut down the mirror servers using the stop-tc-server script. 
   If you are using a wrapper solution to manage the mirror servers, execute the wrapper shut
   down command to shut down the mirror servers instead of using the stop-tc-server script.

b. Shut down the clients. A Terracotta client will shut down when you shut down your application.

c. Shut down the active servers using the stop-tc-server script.
   If you are using a wrapper solution to manage the servers, execute the wrapper shut down
   command to shut down the servers instead of using the stop-tc-server script.
   
2. Install using IBM webMethods Update Manager.
