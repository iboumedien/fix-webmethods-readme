4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

Common Libraries for OpenSSL 11.1



5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.




6.0 Cautions and Warnings

(Linux only) The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH should be unset. If this variable is needed,
its value must not contain the path to the OpenSSL libraries as shipped for the IBM EntireX
product, for example "/opt/softwareag/common/security/openssl/lib", nor the system's standard
paths "/usr/lib64", "/usr/lib", "/lib64" and/or "/lib"!



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include enhancements to
existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed built-in
services, APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before installing
the fix.

This fix is cumulative, which means that it includes all previous fixes for the release.

SSL-264 (SSL_11.1_Fix1)
This fix updates OpenSSL libraries to 3.0.15.
The update also contains mitigations for the following OpenSSL security issues:
CVE-2024-5565 (Low) and CVE-2024-6119 (Moderate).
This fix also updates the packaged set of RootCA certificates as published by Mozilla for their
NSS library to the current state as of 2024-10-29.



8.0 Installation

Install using Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at 
https://docs.webmethods.io/.

(Linux only) If not done already, either install all mentioned products below "/opt/softwareag" or
create a symbolic link at "/opt/softwareag" pointing to the actual installation directory.

(Linux only) Some products might still setup the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH and append
the system's standard paths "/usr/lib64", "/usr/lib", "/lib64" and/or "/lib". They usually do this
via a script ending on "env" and residing in the product's INSTALL/-directory, e.g.
/opt/softwareag/EntireX/INSTALL/exxenv_, etc. These lines have to be edited and the system's
standard paths need to be removed.
Example before editing:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${exxlibpath}:/lib64:/usr/lib64
Example after editing:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${exxlibpath}

*Please note*, these changes are only necessary on Linux systems when either the system's tools or
one of the mentioned products cannot be started and fail to resolve symbols from the OpenSSL
libraries. The changes should not be made on other systems!



9.0 Uninstallation

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the most recently installed fix. This action 
will revert your installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot use these instructions to 
uninstall the previously installed fix.

Uninstall using Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at 
https://docs.webmethods.io/.
