1.0 Fix Name

My webMethods Server 11.1 Fix 2.



2.0 Fix ID

MWS_11.1_Fix2



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

Fixes are cumulative. Therefore, for each of the listed fixes, you can install the specified fix or 
later.



5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

1. Back up the My webMethods Server database and file system before installing this fix.

2. Before starting a Fix installation shut down all IBM My webMethods Server cluster nodes. 
   IBM Update Manager will shut down and restart IBM My webMethods Server during fix 
   installation. IBM Update Manager waits for a preconfigured time of 300000 ms (5 mins) 
   for IBM My webMethods Server to shut down and restart. If a particular IBM My webMethods Server 
   installation takes more time for shutdown and restart, you can configure the wait time by setting
   the following system property for IBM Update Manager: 
   -Dmws.shutdown.waittime = <time_in_ms>
   
3. If multiple nodes exist in one installation directory, the IBM Update Manager will 
   install the fix on all the nodes.	
  
4. If the cluster nodes are on different installation/machines, the fix installation should be done 
   sequentially for each IBM My webMethods Server cluster node. Wait for IBM Update Manager to 
   complete Fix installation on one IBM My webMethods Server installation before installing the fix 
   to another cluster node installation/machine.

5. If you have a webMethods product that runs outside of the current webMethods installation 
   directory (the directory in which you installed this fix) and uses any of the files in
   <webMethods_directory>/common/lib, then apply this fix to the other product installation

6. Applying a fix reverts the MWS\server\default\bin\server.properties.[bat|sh],
   MWS\bin\setenv.[bat|sh], MWS\bin\mws.[bat|sh], MWS\server\default\config\wrapper.conf files to
   their default contents.
   If you made changes to these files, create a backup of these files before installing the fix, 
   and change the required values again after the fix installation completes.



7.0 Fix Contents

existing functionality and features. Any of these items can result in new or changed 
built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. Review the fix contents carefully before
