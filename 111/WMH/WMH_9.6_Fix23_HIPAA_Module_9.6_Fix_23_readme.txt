WMH-579 (WmHipaa_Fix19)
The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service generates implementation acknowledgment 999 
with an incorrect date for ISA09 and GS04 fields. This happens when 999 
generates during the year's end, wherein the year portion of the date gets 
changed from the current year to next year.

This issue is resolved.


WMH-574 (WmHipaa_Fix19)

In IBM webMethods module for Hipaa, pub.estd.hipaa:validate service throws
inappropriate errors when validating either the 837 Professional or 837
Institutional messages simultaneously with the 837 Dental messages.

This issue is resolved.

In IBM webMethods Module for HIPAA, when HIPAA TPA contains multiple severity 
configurations for the same snip validation level, such as Severity "Ignore" 
(with errorIDs specified) and other Severity "Error" in mentioned order, then 
pub.estd.hipaa:validate service ignores all the errors instead of ignoring only 
the specific error codes.

This issue is resolved now.


WMH-570 (WmHipaa_Fix18)

In IBM webMethods Module for HIPAA, pub.estd.hipaa:validate service is not 
taking TPA configuration from default TPA when partner-specific TPA is disabled.

This issue is resolved now.

WMH-561 (WmHipaa_Fix18)

In IBM webMethods module for Hipaa, after migrating TN documents from 
integration server having webmethods HipaaLink Module installed to higher 
intergration server,throws the following error :
"Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'pk_BizDocTypeDef_TypeId'.
Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.BizDocTypeDef'. The duplicate key
value is (EDITechnicalAck---------)" occurs during startup.

This happens when migrated TN database contains document X12 TA1 with id type
"EDITechnicalAck---------" installed using webMethods hipaalink module and
IBM webMethods module for Hipaa tries to install document X12 TA1 ACK document 
with same id type.


WMH-558 (WmHipaa_Fix18)

In IBM webMethods module for Hipaa, pub.estd.hipaa:validate service fails with
following exception java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
This issue occurs when we run pub.estd.hipaa:validate service for certain 837 
messages in multiple threads.

This issue is now resolved.


WMH-555 (WmHipaa_Fix18)

In IBM webMethods module for Hipaa, error code "ERROR_HIPAA_FIELD_CONTENT" 
reported for errors like "Segment HI_ExternalCauseOfInjury_2300 contains 
ICD-10-CM codes. It is necessary to report a series of 3 external cause of 
injury codes to fully describe an injury. It is very generic and unable to 
ignore this particular error by configuring this error code in TPA as it can 
impact other error cases.

This issue is now resolved. New error code "ERROR_HIPAA_FIELD_SERIES_MAX_OCCUR"
is introduced for errors related to error scenario where predefined series of
fields in a segment are required to be present.


WMH-554 (WmHipaa_Fix18)

In IBM webMethods module for Hipaa, pub.estd.hipaa:validate service was not 
throwing any error for the following scenarios:

- when N403 contains only five-digit for segments where full nine-digit zip code
  is required as per the HIPAA implementation guide.
- when N404 contains the country code of Canada and N403 contains a value other 
  than the format 'XXXXXX' consisting of 6 alphanumeric characters.
These issues are now resolved.

 used.
- CAS05, CAS08, CAS11, CAS14 and CAS14 element values of 837 Professional,
Institutional and Dental has been already used.
- When segment HI-External Cause of Injury contains ICD-10-CM codes and doesn't
report series of 3 codes.
- When segment NM1 has data element NM102 as 1 and NM104 is missing in 837
message.
These issues are now resolved and proper error is thrown.


WMH-541 (WmHipaa_Fix17)

In IBM webMethods module for HIPAA, pub.estd.hipaa:validate service does not
function as expected in the following scenarios:
- When partner-specific TPA is created, pub.estd.hipaa:validate service still
takes the default HIPAA TPA.
- No error was thrown for incorrect LX01 field in LX segment.
- A non-numeric value in SV102 caused â€œjava.lang.NumberFormatException: For 
input string: "UN".
- No error was thrown for incorrect ZIP code format used in N403 field.
These issues are now resolved.


WMH-537 (WmHipaa_Fix17)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service returns a validation error for 837
transactions that contains the REF segment with value for the field REF02 as
'000000000', when field REF01 is "EI".

This issue is now resolved.

WMH-519 (WmHipaa_Fix16)

In IBM webMethods Module for HIPAA, pub.estd.hipaa:validate service for 837 
HIPAA message, returns error for Claim level balancing validation even when line 
level payment information is not present. Also in the service line level 
balancing, multiple occurrences of Loop 2430 for the same payer was not 
considered for balancing check calculation.

These issues are resolved now.


WMH-517 (WmHipaa_Fix15)

The 'pub.estd.hipaa:validate' service returns 999 acknowledgement with incorrect
values in IK4 segment and CTX05 element when the description was missing in
SV101-7, SV202-7, and SV301-7 for Professional, Institutional and Dental claims
for a non-specific procedure code in SV101-2, SV202-2, and SV301-2 respectively
for 837 transactions.
This issue is now resolved and the service returns 999 acknowledgement with
correct values.


WMH-505 (WmHipaa_Fix14)

Previously, rounding off calculated value for fraction part was not matching
with expected data due to incorrect calculated value or difference in fraction
part.

This issue is resolved and rounding off fractional part is controlled by
configuring the property "wm.hipaa.pattern.roundOff" in the config.cnf file that
is located in "...\packages\WmHipaa\config\" folder.

Note : Format for this property should match this expression "^(#.(#{1,3}))$". 


WMH-500 (WmHipaa_Fix14)

HIPAA code functionality is enhanced by fixing the known issues in the module
pertaining to 837 Professional, 837 Institutional, and 837 Dental message type. 


WMH-496 (WmHipaa_Fix14)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service, used for HIPAA message validation, is 
blocked while parsing segment. When segment's qualifier matches with the 
previous Loop qualifier and if the previous loop is not present in the input 
message, it creates infinite loops and thereby, causing high CPU usages.

This issue is resolved. 


WMH-485 (WmHipaa_Fix14)

Previously the pub.estd.hipaa:validate service did not returning a validation
error when description was missing in SV101-7, SV202-7, and SV301-7 for
Professional,Institutional and Dental claims for a non-specific procedure
code in SV101-2, SV202-2, and SV301-2 respectively for 837 transactions.

This issue is now resolved. 


WMH-483 (WmHipaa_Fix13)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service used for HIPAA message validation generates
999 with full segment data in place of empty data for IK404 element when the 
required data element is missing in the segment and the HTML report displays the
same in ErrorFieldData column.

This issue is resolved now. 


WMH-482 (WmHipaa_Fix13)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service in webMethods 10.1 incorrectly counts the
value field of AK904 (Number of Accepted Transaction Sets) when there are
informational or warning errors in the trasaction set.

This issue is resolved. 


WMH-481 (WmHipaa_Fix13)

Previously, the calculated value did not match with the expected value due to 
difference in decimal points as they were not rounded off. 

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service used for HIPAA message displays SNIP 3 
balancing errors even when the expected and calculated values are the same in
837 message type.
    
This issue is resolved.


WMH-479 (WmHipaa_Fix13)

While using the HIPAA module, the existing DB script for code source creation 
displays a compilation error for Microsoft SQL Server. A separate Microsoft SQL
Server 2019 DB script for code source creation was added.

This issue is now resolved. 


WMH-476 (WmHipaa_Fix13)

HIPAA code functionality is enhanced by fixing the known issues in the module.


WMH-467 (WmHipaa_Fix12)

In 277 HIPAA message, if the SVC01-1 field is present with a
value "NU" (revenue code), then SVC04 field must not be present in the message.
However, IBM webMethods Module for HIPAA does not validate this.

Additionally, in the error report the error field data displayed is incorrect.
Instead of displaying the value of the field that should not be present in the
message, it displays the value of the conditional field. For example, in the
above case, the value of SVC01-1 field is displayed.

These issues are resolved. Now, HIPPA module performs a validation of the fields
and the error report displays the correct data. 


WMH-454 (WmHipaa_Fix11)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service used for HIPAA message validation, sometimes
generates 999 with incorrect Business Unit Identifier that is, CTX segment.

Example: In 999 for 837 transaction, the value in CTX01-2 always appears to be
the Patient Control Number (CLM01) from the first claim in the transaction set,
even if there is no error in the first claim. Also, it does not report the 
correct Patient Control Number (CLM01). 

This issue is resolved. Now this message is not displayed. 


WMH-453 (WmHipaa_Fix11)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service displays a validation error for 837
transactions that contain a Patient Demographic Information DMG segment in the
2010CA loop.

This issue is now resolved. 


WMH-452 (WmHipaa_Fix11)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service, which is used for HIPAA message validation
generates the following validation error when the 2420E loop occurs before
2420C loop:
"Unidentified data found"

The order of multiple subloops that do not involve hierarchical structure and
have the same numeric position within the transaction are not required to be 
sent in the same order in which they appear in the implementation guide.

This issue is resolved. Now, this message is not displayed. 


WMH-445 (WmHipaa_Fix11)

Low performance observed for the pub.estd.hipaa:validate service.

with size greater than 4 MB.

This issue is resolved.


WMH-444 (WmHipaa_Fix11)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service returns a validation error for 837
transactions that contain a Prior Authorization REF segment in the loop 2400.

This issue is now resolved.


WMH-443 (WmHipaa_Fix11)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service generates implementation acknowledgment 999
with incorrect field value or missing data for IK3 and IK4 segments. Also the
HTML report contains errors, such as missing ErrorFieldData, position,
SegmentData, ErrorMessage, or incorrect field value.

Examples:
- IK302 contains a segment position, which is one less than the actual position.
  This can happen when extra elements are present in a segment.
- IK303 exceeds the maximum length of four, when the loop id is more then
  length4 (example, 2310AC).
- IK401 is generated with incorrect value. It is empty, -1, or contains a
  leading zero. For example, CRC SEGMENT containing a value other than NU in
  CRC03 when CRC02 is N.
- IK401-2 is not generated when errors are reported in SV107 segment sub-element
  and contains invalid diagnosis code pointer in SV107.
- IK403 is generated with incorrect value. It is either 0 or uses a wrong code
  ("6"). For example, data element SVD02 of the Line Adjudication SVD segment
   containing an amount with more than two decimal places
- IK404 is generated with incorrect value. It is either missing or contains a
  bad code when control characters such as a horizontal tab or a line feed in
  a data element.
- IK3 segment is generated and followed by a Business Unit Identifier CTX
  segment, even if the segment with the error occurs before a Business Unit
  Identifier segment. For example, N3_2010AA has errors.
- IK4 segment is not generated when extra elements are present in a segment.
- IK4 segment is not followed by an Element Context CTX segment.
- 999 is generated for errors having any SNIP level severity configuration
  (in TPA) with information, error, and warning, except ignored.
- HTML report contains error reported for AN datatype as SNIPLevel 2 instead of
  SNIPLevel 1.
  
These issue are resolved. 


WMH-430  (WmHipaa_Fix10)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service used for HIPAA message validation is 
generating "The data [D9] is not in the allowed list of enumeration values"
validation error message for REF and DTP segment when they are not present in 
order but present in same logical position .

This issue is resolved. Now this message is not displayed.

anywhere in a data element is not allowed.
3. Any value other than NU in CRC03 when CRC02 is N is not allowed
in the EPSDT Referral CRC segment
4.Having a date range where the start date is after the end
date in DTP03 of a DTP segment is incorrect.
5. The inclusion of extra sub-elements in an element or
extra elements in a segment result is incorrect.
6. Having an amount with more than two decimal places in
SVD02 of the Line Adjudication SVD segment is incorrect. 
7. Using an invalid diagnosis code pointer in SV107 is incorrect. 


WMH-428  (WmHipaa_Fix10)

Loop_2320, the validation service displays the NullPointerException error.

This issue is resolved.


WMH-394 (WmHipaa_Fix8)

The pub.estd.hipaa:validate service used for HIPAA message validation generates 
997 and 999 acknowledgements with some of the segments having data element 
delimiter '*' instead of the actual data element delimiter in the input HIPAA 
message. 

This issue is resolved. 


WMH-385 (WmHipaa_Fix7)

In any data field, if a header control segment such as ISA, GS, or ST
suffixed with a data element delimiter is present, then the HIPAA module treats
data in the data field as a header.

This issue is resolved.

Validation passes even though value of REF03 field is missing 
when REF01 is 0B in 5010-278 message for the Loop 2010F. 

In the 5010-278 message when 2010F-REF01=0B then the field REF03 
is required. But the Module 9.6 for HIPAA does not report an 
error even though value of REF03 field is missing. 

This issue is resolved. Now, the module reports an error if the 
value of REF03 field is missing when 2010F-REF01=0B.

in the View page after reloading the WmHIPAA package. 

View page to view code sources does not list the code set values 
when the WmHIPAA package is reloaded after table creation. 

This issue is resolved.


WMH-252 (WmHipaa_Fix1)

IBM webMethods Module 9.6 for HIPAA fails to validate a valid 
Social Security Number in the NM109 field of the 278 message in 
the Loop 2010B. 

The module identifies the value in the field NM109 as the 
Social Security Number only when the value of NM108 field is set 
to 34. The validation of NM109 fails even though the condition is 
met because the module considers the format of the value to be 
incorrect. 

This issue is resolved. Now, the module identifies the format in 
NM109 as the Social Security Number and correctly validates the 
information.

This issue is resolved. Now, the module updates the valid and 
invalid HIPAA data in the validData and invalidData output 
variables
