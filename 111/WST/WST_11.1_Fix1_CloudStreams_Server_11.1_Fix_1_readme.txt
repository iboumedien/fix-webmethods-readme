1.0 Fix Name

IBM webMethods CloudStreams Server 11.1 Fix 1



2.0 Fix ID

WST_11.1_Fix1


3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

This fix affects IBM webMethods CloudStreams Server 11.1



4.0 Requirements and Dependencies

This fix requires the latest available fixes to be installed 
in advance. In addition, follow the post install instructions.


5.0 Platform Support
IBM webMethods CloudStreams Server 11.1 Fix 1 is supported on 
all platforms supported by IBM webMethods CloudStreams Server 
10.15.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

None.



7.0 Fix Contents 

WST-8629 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

If a user clicks the "Help" link on the "About" page in 
CloudStreams, it previously led to a blank page. This 
issue is now resolved.

WST-8761 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

Previously, when creating a REST connector using a Swagger 
V2.0 file, parameters of type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
were being skipped. This issue is now resolved.


WST-8675 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

Session tokens in webMethods Integration are automatically 
refreshed during service execution for all CloudStreams-based 
accounts when the session is detected as expired, based on 
the session timeout configuration. However, the refresh call 
does not respect the response timeout defined in the account 
configuration. Consequently, if the token refresh request is 
delayed or stuck, the main service execution thread is also 
blocked, leading to a hang.

This issue is now resolved. 

WST-8829 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

While creating a REST connector by importing a Swagger file, 
the "Accept" header was not being mapped correctly. Additionally, 
neither the "Content-Type" nor the "Accept" header was being 
mapped when importing an OpenAPI V3 file.

This issue is now resolved.

WST-8779 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

Previously, when creating a REST connector using an OpenAPI 
file, the request JSON body for a resource was not generated 
correctly. This issue is now resolved. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

WST-8766 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

Previously, when creating a REST connector using a Swagger 
V2.0 file, no resources were generated if the file did not 
contain "definitions". This issue is now resolved. In such 
cases, an empty document will be created along with the resources.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

WST-8637 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

If the input data for a CloudStreams service execution 
is very large, enabling trace-level logging may result 
in an "Out of Memory" error. This issue is now resolved.

To avoid potential issues, it is recommended to refrain 
from enabling trace logging when working with large input data.

WST-8735 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

When a Salesforce listener encountered the "Buffering 
capacity XXXX exceeded" error during runtime, it would 
repeatedly re-subscribe to the backend, eventually 
exhausting the daily event transaction limit in Salesforce.

This issue is now resolved. If the error occurs again, 
the listener will be suspended automatically.

WST-8993 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

The following issues were encountered when adding 
the Start Sequence action:

The ListDependents service did not return the correct 
results when populating data for each dependent.
A Null Pointer Exception (NPE) occurred due to an 
unnecessary declaration of the ModelReaderWriter 
object in a child class, even though it was already 
declared and initialized in the parent class.

Both issues have now been resolved.

WST-9081 (WST_11.1_Fix1)

Users encountered a 403 Forbidden error while enabling 
a Jira basic connection. The error occurred because the 
system was sending an HTTP GET request with an empty 
body but with an XML header.

The issue is now resolved by updating the logic to 
attach the XML header only when a payload exists.


8.0 Installation

Step 1: Install using the IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions,
see the documentation at https://docs.webmethods.io.

Note: If you have migrated your connector services from a version
prior to CloudStreams 9.7 and impacted by WST-2213, and you are
yet to run the migration utility as suggested in WST-2213, go to
Step 2, else skip Step 2. If you have created your connector 
services with a CloudStreams 9.7 or later version, you do not 
need to run the migration utility

Step 2: Run the CloudStreams migration utility
(pub.cloudstreams.migration:migrate) to migrate your old
CloudStreams artifacts to the latest version.
For more information on the migration utility, see the 
Integration Server upgrade section in the "Upgrading Software 
AG Products" guide.

Step 3: In Integration Server, under Settings > Extended > 
Extended Settings, add "watt.net.ssl.client.useJSSE=true" to 
use the latest TLS versions.
Note: Restart Integration Server after applying the above 
property. In most cases, only this property is required for 
SaaS providers like Salesforce.
In some cases, where you want to force usage of any other 
protocols, for example, SSLv3 or a particular version of TLS 
properties, use the following properties:
 - watt.net.jsse.client.enabledProtocols
 - watt.net.ssl.client.handshake.minVersion
See the webMethods Integration Server Administrator Guide 
for the desired values of these properties.

Step 4: For a few SaaS back ends, the underlying JVM trust store 
may have the required certificates and you may not need to 
follow this step. But for back ends which have certificates 
that are not part of the JVM trust store, create and apply a 
new trust store in Integration Server with the certificates 
of the SaaS back end. This is a standard practice 
for setting up secure exchange of certificates. If the trust 
store is not present, in such cases, certificate related 
errors will appear.
To set up secure exchange of certificates, create a JKS trust 
store with the certificates of the SaaS back end. The trust 
store should contain all the certificates present in the 
certificate chain. Apply the trust store in the Integration 
Server administration page at the "Security > Keystore" 
section and use that trust store alias in your CloudStreams 
connection in the "Trust Store" field.
To know more about creating trust stores and applying them in 
Integration Server, see the "Securing Communications with the 
Server" section in the webMethods Integration Server 
Administrator Guide. Also see the relevant CloudStreams 
Provider document to find the connection's advanced property 
"Trust store Alias", for applying the trust store in the 
connection.
Note: You can also create trust stores using a publicly 
available tool, for example, Keytool or KeyStore Explorer.

Step 5: If the Integration Server version is 10.0, 
and if you are impacted by WST-3082, then
manually edit the manifest.v3 file located under the
WmCloudStreams package to include the following entry:

<value name="classloader">package</value>

Restart Integration Server.

Step 6: If the Integration Server version is 10.15,
and if you are impacted by WST-6720, then manually 
edit the wst-config.properties file located under the
<SAG-Installation-directory>\IntegrationServer\instances
\default\packages\WmCloudStreams\config\resources to include 
the following entry: wst.allow.301.redirect=true

Restart Integration Server.


9.0 Uninstallation

Uninstall using IBM webMethods Update Manager. For instructions, 
see the documentation at https://docs.webmethods.io.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the 
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your 
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot 
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.

1. After uninstallation, remove the 
"watt.net.ssl.client.useJSSE=true" property in Integration 
Server under "Settings > Extended > Extended Settings".

2. Remove the trust store alias from your connection if 
created, and also the trust store alias entry from 
Integration server.
