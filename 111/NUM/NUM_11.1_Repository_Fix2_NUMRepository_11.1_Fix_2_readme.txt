NUM-23833 (NUM_11.1_wM_SharedBundles_Fix2)
In Universal Messaging, exceeding the warning threshold configured for direct and heap memory might result in degraded JVM performance.

The issue is resolved.

NUM-23914 (NUM_11.1_wM_SharedBundles_Fix2)
The Universal Messaging realm servers fail to join a Universal Messaging cluster with the following error: "Remote connection failed security challenge". The Universal Messaging clients cannot establish a connection to the realm servers or the connection is slow with the same error message.
The issue occurs because of incorrect header values exchanged during the authentication.
The issue is resolved. A new parameter with name com.softwareag.um.authentication.maxHeaderCount and default value of 0 has been added to limit the number of headers exchanged. Do not change the default value of the parameter as it is used when the server communicates with a client that uses headers.

NUM-22883 (NUM_11.1_wM_SharedBundles_Fix2)
Reconnect logic uses uses JMS flag which results in dead session to be left in session pool. As part of the fix, Flag for shouldTryToReconnect() logic is set separately for native session and JMS. 

For native session, the flag can be set/unset from environment variable "com.softwareag.um.client.retry_reconnect_on_security_exception" with default value being true. For JMS, it can be set/unset using com.pcbsys.nirvana.nJMS.Constants#setReconnectAfterAccessChange() API, by default value is set to false.









8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at https://docs.webmethods.io.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix,
please shut down any applications such as Integration Server
or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager
fix, you do not need to shut down the Universal Messaging server.

Uninstall using the Update Manager or
Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions, see the
corresponding documentation at https://docs.webmethods.io/.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.
