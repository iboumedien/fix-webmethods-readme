Multiple examples from Swagger are not displayed in UI.

When you generate an API from a Swagger definition that includes multiple examples,
the first one of the multiple examples is shown in the API Gateway. Also, if the
API is published to Developer Portal and if you edit the same and republish it to
Developer Portal, then all examples do not appear in Developer Portal.

The multiple examples format should be look like below:

{
"<example_name>": {
"value": "{}"
},
"<example_name>": {

YAI-40997 (Fix 6)
The URL sent by user invoking API is being decoded when ‘sendClientRequestURI’ is set to true and invoke webmethodIS is configured. The URL should not be decoded if ‘sendClientRequestURI’ is set to true.

The 'sendClientRequestURI' is not handled when invoke webmethodIS is configured. When invoke webmethodIS is configured, the unchanged URL is sent to it but is then decoded when invoking native service.

When ‘sendClientRequestURI’ variable is set to true in extended settings, the URL sent by user invoking API will not be decoded by the API Gateway, irrespective of whether invoke webmethodIS is configured. The URL will be passed as it is to the native service. When the 'sendClientRequestURI' is set to false API Gateway will decode the URL.


This issue is resolved.


YAI-41006 (Fix 6)
DELETE requests to native provider fails due to an incorrect Content-Type header value.

When an API is invoked with the Delete method, the header Content-Type=$wm_default is added automatically causing the requests to be blocked by the native providers.

This issue is resolved. The DELETE command without Content-Type work for all types of native services.


YAI-40670 (Fix 6)
When API Gateway used a shared reporting pool to send transaction data to all configured destinations. This setup caused issues when a single destination experienced high latency or became unreachable, as it impacted the reporting performance for all other destinations.

This has now been improved. Each destination is assigned its own dedicated reporting pool. As a result, issues with one destination will no longer affect the others. By default, each destination is initialized with a predefined pool size and thread count, but these settings can be customized for individual customers through REST APIs if needed.

This issue is resolved. Now a separate reporting pool for each destination is implemented so that if one destination has problem, other destinations are not affected.

 

YAI-40099 (Fix 5)
Downloading  the files from api details  documentation section gives invalid error details. 
It has been fixed now.

Now it gives proper error message if the swagger is invalid.


YAI-40873 (Fix 5)
API Gateway restart fails when using externalized configuration.

With externalized configuration both the ElasticSearch user password and
the Kibana user password are obfuscated with the same key
'@secure.elasticsearch.http.password'. As a consequence, the next API Gateway
restart fails as the ElasticSearch user password has been destroyed.

This issue is resolved now.


YAI-40863 (Fix 5)
Externalized configuration in API Gateway for analytics hosts considers only
one host even when there are multiple hosts configured.

When more than one analytics node is specified, through apigw.analytics.ds.hosts,
the configuration step terminates with error. 

This issue is resolved. Now, all the specified host addresses are used for the
analytics part.


YAI-40023 (Fix 5)
When creating an Application from Developer Portal to API Gateway application gets created successfully.
However, on Developer Portal under Application Creation Request page the status shows as "In Progress" and it is stuck in delivered to API Gateway when approval workflow for registering an application is enabled.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-40010 (Fix 5)
Error in response during conditional error processing. 

When you use ${time} during conditional error processing, the system displays
only HH:mm (Hours and minutes) in response and does not display seconds. 

This issue is resolved. The default format for system context variable ${time}
is updated to HH:mm:ss and the timeVariableFormat extended setting is
introduced to change the time format.

YAI-39901 (Fix 4)
Extending a global policy filter does not work.

In an API Gateway cluster a global policy is activated and hence affects a 
certain number of APIs. The global policy is now updated with a filter
'ApiName NotEquals' which means that after the update the global policy affects 
less number of APIs. In the API Gateway UI the global policy update terminates 
successfully. When you inspect the global policy and the affected APIs in 
the UI, in particular the APIs that are no longer affected after the update
because they match the 'ApiName NotEquals' filter, everything looks good. When 
you issue REST or SOAP calls against the cluster node that performed the global 
policy update for those APIs that are no longer affected by the global policy 
the calls behave as expected. However, when the same REST or SOAP calls are 
issued against one of the other cluster nodes, it is observed that the policy 
actions defined by the global policies are still applied to the APIs that match 
the 'ApiName NotEquals' filter.

The issue is resolved.




YAI-40047 (Fix 4)
Previously saving enum integer values were treated as strings. After the fix it will be treated as integers.
This issue is fixed.


YAI-39446 (Fix 4)
JMS/AMQP REST routing fails with JNDI alias for queues/topics.

When working with JMS/AMQP REST routing for an API, if the JNDI alias is used to
look up queues and topics, it does not work. However, when the queue name is 
provided directly as the destination name, it works fine.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-39772 (Fix 4)
There was a regression from the fix on Configuring Analytics Destination in Apigateway,  Due to which the API gateway couldn't start.

This issue is resolved now.

YAI-39738 (Fix 4)
API Gateway starts listening on the ports before the startup is fully completed.

A wsdl-request during API Gateway startup may fail, as API Gateway starts 
listening on the ports before the startup is completed and APIs are not fully 
loaded.

This issue is resolved.


YAI-39658 (Fix 4)
Validate API Specification policy for an incoming request does not work for a 
SOAP API.

activation fails.

This issue is resolved.



YAI-39442(Fix 4)
Deployment of OAuth2 clients from CentraSite is enhanced.

The deployment of OAuth2 clients from CentraSite is improved in 2 areas:
1. On deploy the values are completely setup. It is not necessary to regenerate,
which means client IDs and secrets are in line with the CentraSite values.
2. On a redeploy or update from CentraSite the OAuth2 values are no longer  
changed or overwritten. This means that changes on OAuth2 values can only be 
performed with API Gateway methods.


YAI-39284 (Fix 4)

When the Elasticsearch status is red, API Gateway does not display any errors or
exceptions in the log.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-39109 (Fix 3)
API Gateway does not terminate the request whenever native URLs fails to provide
response within the specified time interval.

When the Loadbalancing endpoints all result in 408 after waiting for timeout,
the request does not terminate but tries to connect in a repeat mode, which
leads to a hung server.

This issue is resolved. The request now terminates after all endpoints are not
successful.

YAI-39125 (Fix 3)
Update in analytics configuration in the API Gateway UI overwrites the
keystore and truststore values in analyticsds.properties.

When you update the analytics configuration in API Gateway UI, it overwrites
the existing keystore and truststore information in the analyticsds.properties
file. However, the updated values will not take effect during the next API
Gateway startup.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-39130 (Fix 3)
Disabling Pass WS-Security Headers does not work when using request processing
with IS service.

When using a SOAP API with request processing configured to use the
'Invoke WebMethods IS' policy, and the service is configured to
'Comply with IS Spec', the WS-Security header is passed to the native service.
This occurs even when the 'Pass WS-Security Headers' option is disabled in the
routing policy.

This issue is resolved.

YAI-39172 (Fix 3)
SOAP API not working after migration to API Gateway 10.15
